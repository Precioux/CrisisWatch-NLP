doqwow,2019-10-29 14:52:02,depression,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",2366,177,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/

I know it’s never been enough, and I just can’t do it anymore. Every bit of this life is utter pain, relieved only by a few minutes of sleep, where I dream of having friends, where I dream of being in school, where I dream of having relationships that don’t destroy my soul. Those dreams only last a few minutes, once a week or two, often prefaced or followed by intense psychological nightmares.

I’m still worried and stressed and depressed, but I’m gonna go through another day. Ill make a plan on what to do if I get close to this again. I’ll research mental health and make my own healing path. I did it before, I can do it again.

here’s where it sucks for me. I don’t feel like i’ve accomplished shit. everywhere it just feels condescending like people just look down at me.  I have deep and long relationships with friends but I still feel just an empty pit of loneliness. There’s been a couple of other events that i won’t get into but I’ve been through these depression episodes since 8th grade. this one has been going on for 7 months and it’s only been getting shittier. usually when i have these little depressive episodes they get better and better. i’ve asked for help before in 8th grade and 10th grade. 8th grade i got told i was a fucking liar basically and 10th grade therapy didn’t do shit for me. so I just sucked it up and kept it pushing solo. i’m trying to do that now but it’s not working and I don’t feel like reaching out for help because that is just being a burden and ungrateful to what i have. 

yes I do suffer from suicidal thoughts and have planned them out before. this has been going on since 8th grade as well. I just want to fucking die sometimes and now it’s becoming more of a daily thought.  whether that be through overdosing, jumping off a balcony, or having the most tragic shit happen to me. And logically it’s like i’m blessed too so there shouldn’t be shit to complain about as well. i don’t know how much longer i can think like this before i actually do something to myself.

i just want to feel accepted

1jqktxf,2025-04-03 15:04:51,depression,Is life actually worth of living?,"to be clear, for some people life is 100% worth of living. Even for depressed people, even though you are struggling, there is always hope. Life isn’t wonderful, but as long as you’re alive, it can become. 

But also, for some people like me, life is just pure suffering. I was born ugly, stupid and unlucky. I had my third suicide attempt last week, everyone is soo worried for me and scared to even leave me alone. I feel so bad for being such a burden to them, but I can’t keep living for them. I am so tired for living for other people and their feelings. My doctor is trying to make me go to a psych ward, but I just don’t want to. I am on so many medication that I don’t even feel anything anymore. The only time when I feel happy, or when I feel anything at all, is when I am on hard drugs. But still, I haven’t feel happy for so long that I’ve forgot what happiness feels like. I am finishing nursing school in a few months, I’ll probably go to medical school to be a doctor, maybe I have a future but at this point it means nothing to me. I am so deep in this dark place that I don’t know if I’ll ever get out. I don’t even feel like I don’t deserve to live anymore. At this point, I REFUSE to live. I refuse to live in this sick, twisted world where women are so dehumanised, abused and used on a daily basis. I refuse to live in the world where my classmates (future doctors) are making fun of patients with serious illnesses bc they have to do colonoscopy or some medical procedure where they have to be naked or something similar. I refuse to live as a lesbian in this homophobic country. I refuse to live as this person I deeply hate. I refuse to live if I am not perfect. If I don’t have a perfect body, face, grades, if I am not smart etc etc. I am constantly chasing for something to grasp for, for any kind of at least fake hope, but at this point, there’s nothing. For me, life is just suffering and totally unworthy of living. I don’t see the point of reaching for help, of trying to chase fake happiness with drugs that are slowly destroying me, of fighting, of anything anymore. Does anyone else feel this way?

1jqhtp6,2025-04-03 13:01:07,depression,Finding out suicidal thoughts are not normal,"The other day I was on call with my psychiatrist, and I hadn’t been truthful with her during our first meeting so I came clean. I told her that I had attempted suicide in the past. When she asked me when the last time I had seriously considered suicide was, I (proudly) told her I hadn’t thought of it seriously in a week (not including passive thoughts about wanting to die/ not exist). 

The thing is prior to being on medication I thought about killing myself CONSTANTLY. So, I thought it wasn’t such a big deal that these thoughts were still coming but with less frequency. My psychiatrist was kinda surprised and said she’d need to get me a “safety plan” with my university (basically emergency resources in case I had a crisis) and said we’d discuss increasing my medication and also the “fatal” side effects. For now I’m still taking the minimum dose. 

I just wanted to share. I sorta always knew it wasn’t normal to feel constantly suicidal, but it’s so normal to me. ",60,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jqhtp6/finding_out_suicidal_thoughts_are_not_normal/
1jr3k9a,2025-04-04 04:35:41,depression,I absolutely hate my life right now,"March was a rough month. I was laid off from my job in preparation for tariffs. I finally had a job where I wasnt paycheck to paycheck and enjoyed what I did. A week later I had an accident leaving me with a broken jaw, 3 messed up teeth, and nerve damage. No insurance or income. 

I refuse to pull my teeth, they’re in the front. They can be saved with root canals and crowns. But I can’t eat and barely talk, which is mostly from my jaw.

I was offered a job. A 33,000 pay cut, but I get insurance right away. And I absolutely hate it. I’ve had another job offer, something I’d be happy with and the same pay, but wouldn’t have insurance for 3 months. And right now I desperately need insurance. So I took the dreaded job. 9 hours of my day I’m absolutely miserable. I can barely talk, but being in customer service I have to. I haven’t eaten in 2 weeks, just protein shakes and ensure. Doctor gave me vitamins that make me so sick every day. I’m constantly in pain all day. I started door dashing, so when I’m not working I’m dashing. Currently working about 16 hours a day, and truth be told I’m still so far off from being able to afford my medical care.

With insurance I still need to come up with 6000 for my jaw. My teeth, I can get done at dental school for right over $1300 plus crowns compared to $6700 through actual dentist. 

I’m defeated. There’s no light. I hate my job. I’m constantly in pain and sick to my stomach from all the meds I’m on. I’m not suicidal, but I’ve never wanted to be put out of my misery so badly before. 

There’s no family to fall on. Parents don’t support my life and cut me off years ago. I was denied care credit. I can’t commit to paying back a loan.

1jqzp1s,2025-04-04 01:09:22,depression,"Warning: CP, manipulation, death","So I'm having some trouble with smoking, I'm doing it more and more, right, and my lungs have been shitty since I was a kid. I went from one cigarette a month to half a pack every day in the span of a few months and I really don't want this to stay a habit. Part of it is stress smoking because of depression. I'm beginning with this smaller thing to ease y'all into it.

I started smoking because I wanted to be more like my old crush, N, who I was like best friends with for a couple years and I never really got iver them. They were pretty manipulative about it when they found out, like a lot of lying and gaslighting etc. We were no longer close friends at this point, and N had instead begun hanging out with this bitch I'll call C. C is a convicted rapist and pedophile.

I don't know why C was more worth hanging around than me, and it's always bugged me that THIS GUY was my replacement. I always knew there were rumors he was a rapist and supposedly convicted. I believed it, and I guess I was right to do so. Now, he's been found with 80 pictures of cp, mostly pre pubertal kids and some of them in diapers. Can it get more fucked up? Yes it can.

In the police reports, paid for by a friend of a friend who then spread the pictures of them, everything is in extreme detail. C basically confessed to all of it with a very weak excuse for it, saying he just looked it up for shock value and stuff, and often met with somebody else on the weekends where they swapped shocking pics, for some reason. I know C and N go to different schools but are still close and have said they're like ""twins"". Yay. Knowing some shit I know about N, like that they've said they sometimes look up very very bad stuff as a form of mental self harm, I'm just afraid the second person mentioned in the police reports is them. I lost a lot of respect when I learned their best friend was a rapist, after all, but if I had any left, now it's gone.

Surely it doesn't get weirder? No, then I bring it up to my mom, and she goes on about how badly sex offenders of this sort get treated in prison, we all know that. Then she brings up vigilante justice, you know, random people taking the law into their own hands, and claims that's common in our country. I disagree with her, as it's not exactly something you hear about often. She counters it by saying she has a friend who has killed a pedophile and that it got covered up by the police. Okayyyy. Apparently this person is someone I've met, too, never knowing he's a killer.

Like, vigilante justice makes sense to me, okay, not the Batman kind, but like, overall, for extreme crimes. But I feel sick both because of what C did, what N may have had to do with it, and the fact my mom just shrugged over what she told me like it was normal. I can't say that was wrong to do, but it is still so fucked up. No mercy for fucking pedophiles, right? I still kind of hate that it happened. Which is weird.

I didn't think the day could get worse, but as I'm smoking to try to think things through, I leave a door open out to our yard and our many cats almost run away, thankfully they didn't make it outside (they're indoor cats) but it scared the life out of me. And then I find out my therapist (not exactly therapist but basically) isn't available and probably quit her job and I don't feel like explaining my whole situation all over again to someone new who won't fucking understand. Then N texts me after months of no contact, only repeating an inside joke we had but I know it's to check whether I've heard the news. And here I am hoping for a response because I'm still in love with this idiot who threw me away like nothing once I admittedly got pretty clingy and replaced me with a sexual predator who likes to look at little kids in ducking DIAPERS. So yeah I'm not doing so good in quitting smoking. I don't know how I haven't had a full meltdown or cut myself yet but I guess it's coming.

Bonus info: N has a variety of self harm methods, not sure if they're still doing it, they've claimed to have stopped which I hope is true. Including: watching CP to make themselves nauseous, showering in too cold or too hot water, once until passing out, cutting themselves, and talking sexually to adults online (back when they were still 17). I was always worried sick.

1jr3piq,2025-04-04 04:44:18,depression,Been rejected for over 8 years,"Got cheated on my first relationship back when I was 19. Apart from that she always use to play games to test me which fucked up my mental health during the relationship. I’ve been trying ever since but I am always very cautious about it amounted the mountain of trust issues, but I keep getting rejected and friend zoned. 

TLDR I am 27 now, and also recently got rejected by a colleague, which was harsh and gave me panic attack for work misbehaviour allegations. Just to give context here is what happened.

I never looked at her in that way but were very good colleagues inside work. Lately since last year we were actively talking with each other on social media as well, but it was all friendly. We share the same level dark humour and brainrot memes. All friendly. This year I dont know what happened. I would catch her looking at me in pantry and when I look back she would look away immediately and smirk in a shy way. She is supper introverted, just like me. But I didn’t think much of it, as I myself was not looking for anything. Suddenly out of know where she tried to make some plans with me specifically after office over the weekend, which I refused with an excuse got some work over the weekend. She would again raise that when we were chatting and exchanging reels the other day, i said I can go. But I never followed up on it, as I was also not interested that much. Then we had an offsite where we would talk, and she randomly takes the conversations to deep personal level which involves her family and for some reason it also went to her anxiety about dating, and also share yes I have the same anxiety. And yes something was not right, I know I was over reading, maybe I suddenly might have developed an interest. After that I decided let’s give it try reinitiate the weekend plan she pitched before, but for some other reasons we agreed it was not possible during that day, so she offered to cook some food and send over instead. I found that so sweet, no one has ever done that to me in my life 😭 so I mildly suggest that i could come over since we lived reasonably close by, but then I side tracked and said that might not be possible because I have some work and not sure whether I can make it. She said it would be better if I can come over. I said I’ll confirm. So after 6 hours I confirmed. I was terrible confused what going on here. Am I misleading her? So I consulted a friend about the entire situation, the key thing she said a women trusts me enough that she invited me over dinner and it might be a good sign, but don’t go in with expectations. So I go over with no expectations, the moment u arrived she starts pestering me with food wtf 😭 why tf is she so sweet to me, I said you don’t want me to eat alone so she accompanied. We were talking and talking, her being her introverted self and shy, somehow ended up in conversation, where I told her she sings great (she was singing every now and then), to which I made a joke to not make the complement sound weird of too rushed “I used to sing as well, but that only due to my break up 😭”, too which she pressed and asked when was the last breakup, after I answered she started talking about her last breakup which causes her anxiety to date. Rest of the night went well, I tried leaving earlier but she insisted on staying a bit, then I fucked off. 

The next day, I was so anxious, I consulted my friend again, she suggested I should get to obviously no her more, because even I had the anxiety of dating that force myself not indulge further. I decided that was it, let her advance further if needed. But my friend said I should probably invite her over coffee after office sometime. So I texted her “hey yesterday was fun! There is a new cafe that opened near office would like to go and check it out once, would you be interested to join over coffee?” To which she replied are you asking casually or are you asking me over a date? I got a bit nervous as this was not loooking good. So I gave a bit diplomatic response “don’t get me wrong, really like talking yesterday and that’s why wanted to hangout after coffee”, to which she gave a really formal response, she said thanks for letting her know, and she really appreciates the invite, but she does not think it’s appropriate. Holy fuck. What the fuck have i done. To do damage control I replied “thanks for letting me know! I hope I didn’t make you uncomfortable, good night!”, she just replied “not at all! Goodnight!”

Ever since then i haven’t initiated any conversations with her outside work even in social media. At work she seemed normal like before. But I have been on constant anxiety if this escalates to management, or if she talks about this to other colleagues that would have my face loss. I have learned my lesson.  Never shit where you eat. 

It’s just disheartening that over the last 8 years no one has ever said yes, which has affected my self image. At this point I have decided to live alone and financially be prepared for that as well. Being an introvert with social anxiety is just life on hard mode. It’s 1000% easier for me to get a new job than find a fucking date and settle down for bare fucking minimum. Yea and depression kicked in again for this weekend. Sorry for the long read.

1jr3bs3,2025-04-04 04:21:54,depression,Tired of being life's punching bag.,"I'm 31 male still living at home with my parents because I can't find a good paying job to move out on my own. Cost of living is insane. I've been an addict since I was 18, 3 years in recovery now, with a long stretch of sobriety. I thought things were getting better, I started to take care of my mental and physical health more. Getting used to the fact I don't need to bottle my emotions up or numb myself with my addiction.

I got fired from my Job today and I'm just tired. I feel like if been trying to walk up the down escalator my entire life. I didn't relapse, I made it through the day sober but I keep thinking of the fact that, if Death were to visit me and tell me ""it's time"" I wouldn't hesitate to go. I realize sometimes like today, Aside from my two loving parents, I have nobody, I could disappear and nobody would notice or care. I haven't and won't do anything to myself because it would destroy my parents. But I'm tired of being life's punching bag. I don't think I can do this for the rest of my life. I feel like im just drifting through life, no purpose, nobody to care about, been hurt too many times to take a chance and love someone.

My parents are the only thing keeping me here, and it was sad today, I told them, for the first time after the day they're gone. I don't think i'll be around much longer.

I don't feel like doing anything to myself, or relapsing in my addiction. all of that requires energy, and I'm just tired. I'm tired of everything, of life never improving, life seemingly getting worse, more alone as the years go by and I lie to myself at my 12 step meeting saying im fine, im doing better. I'm tired and right now I jsut feel like sitting on a bench outside in the dark, waiting for death so I can finally rest.

1jqvnt3,2025-04-03 22:03:15,depression,Depression got worse after going to university.,"TLDR - I became more depressed in university than in highshcool. 

I had a close knit friendgroup in highschool that I would always be able to hangout with, text, and eat with, after I went to university and parted ways with them, I tried my very best to meet new people, I sat and chatted with people I didnt know in the dining hall, inviting people out for activities, and for the first month of university I really felt that I was making a difference in my life and experienced many things I didn't think I would. Fast forward to now, I didn't retain any friends after the first month, because they ghosted me for some reason, and it was increasingly difficult to meet new people as friendgroups had already formed, so essentially 7 days a week 24 hours a day I've pretty much been completly isolated and my depression has gotten significantly worse. This coupled with the fact that people always said ""uni is going to be a fresh start!"" just pisses me off so much, it isn't true at all.

1jr0083,2025-04-04 01:25:22,depression,kinda feeling lost,"so the title says everything nonetheless but I guess I’ll go into detail what that entails. I’m in college and my life literally only consists of work and school. I stay in my apartment most of the time and hardly go out unless for work and when I am forced to go to lectures or discussions (marked attendance). I feel pretty sad most of the time, not motivated but I’ll get my work done just takes me longer than it probably should take a normal person. the only person I actually enjoy to put effort in talking to is my boyfriend and we’ve been together for the past 3 years. I feel like I sabotage our relationship with my emotions and how much value I put into him in making him like the center of my world. mind you we’re long distance as well so I only see him on the weekends but I don’t find any enjoyment or pleasure in speaking to anyone at work or in class and I mean I don’t feel bad about it either. I also feel like I just love really hard and I don’t feel the same back from him in the way I’d want it to be but I also can’t imagine my life without him too as the times we do get into problems I feel absolutely miserable and it affects my studies. I honestly just don’t know what to do anymore with my life, I feel so sad I feel lonely I honestly just don’t see purpose anymore and I feel like I’m just trying to do this to be an actual functioning human being in this world. I think it’s all hitting more today or I guess now because my boyfriend is on a trip with his friends in Europe and I’m just here and will be by myself for the next following two weeks with nothing really to do. I’ve lossed motivation in going to the gym for some time now and I honestly just hate leaving my apartment. I have family don’t get me wrong, but like I said I have no urge to speak to anyone other than my partner and I’m not really sure why. Just the motivation in doing so is just not there. I want to start therapy again and maybe even go on antidepressants but I’m worried that might affect my relationship. See, I feel like I’m always talking about my relationship and I don’t know why I can’t stop. I feel like my mom, felt like she always prioritized her romantic relationships and without them she was nothing and it’s rubbing off to me. Hardly have a relationship with her though.

1jqxzcn,2025-04-03 23:46:07,depression,I am completely lost in my own head,"
I (18 m) am in my last year of high school, but I have never felt more lonely. Every close friend group I have had has either drifted apart in high school or, with my most recent one, completely pushed me out. 

I’ve been dealing with pretty bad social anxiety and depression since middle school where my friends at the time would relentlessly bully me for being overweight. I would always laugh it off and try to say something back, but it hurt. I started going to the gym mid way through freshman year and now look a little better, but people still make relentless comments about it and I’m just supposed to take it. I think I’m decently strong but all I ever get called is fat and ugly. I look at myself in the mirror and see progress I am proud of, but it always morphs into disgust and hate for what I look like. I go to the gym don’t have the self control to stop myself from eating. 

In school I’m always scared about what people are thinking about me. If they think I’m ugly or fat or weird. I’d like to think I look okay but I’m always so self conscious about it. I see all my friends prospering and receiving positive attention, but all I feel like is the butt of every joke. I’m no longer proud of the things I used to be because my peers are better than me at what feels like almost every task. 

It doesn’t matter that I’m in AP classes when I can barely pass while everyone around me seems to be flying through it. I got pushed out of my friend group because someone who I thought I was good friends with suddenly stopped inviting me out to things with them. It was a party here or there and then it turned into no longer being in holiday events when our entire friend group and even people not close to our friend group were getting invited. No group chats with me in them, no nothing. I asked a couple of my friends from the group what I did and they said nothing, that the guy just doesn’t like me. 

So for most of my senior year I have been at home. Barely going out with one or two friends a couple times a month and spending every break and holiday home alone. There was a whole situation with my girl hooking up with another guy as well, but there is already a post up about that. I just can’t bring myself to hate or dislike these people who seem to dislike me though. I don’t know why but I just can’t. I still want to be their friend, but another part of me knows that I would be doing myself a disservice. This just isn’t how I wanted my senior year to go, isolated from my peers, stuck sitting alone after I bought prom tickets and my friends didn’t tell me they filled up the table, spending all my time at home, and being looked at as a loser by my peers. 

It’s so confusing in my head though. Some days I feel full of myself, like I’m better than others, that I’m stronger or smarter, and then I feel inferior to everyone, like a loser. I hate seeing friends and family in need or isolated, but unless it’s them being left out, I can’t seem to bring myself to care about their problems or how they feel. I know it’s wrong and I want people to be happy but I just don’t feel connected enough to actually obtain a true grasp of how they feel, more like a fleeting moment of it that is quickly replaced by annoyance or apathy. I hate that I’m like this.

I hate being alone, I hate being weird, I hate being fat, I hate being the punching bag for everyone else to make fun of and ignore. I’m not as openly made fun of as some other kids as I try to act as normal and chilled out as possible, taking every insult in the chin and trying to act like just a normal guy, but I still know people do. It hurts not knowing what I did to make people dislike me, to want to apologize but unable to because I don’t know what I’ve done wrong. I feel like a failure, like a background character in my own life. I apologize for everything because I feel bad, not because of how the other person thinks about things, but because I fail to meet the image of the person I want to be. It doesn’t matter that I’ve lost weight, put on muscle, become more normal, become less emotional, or stopped taking things to heart. In my head I still just feel weak.

I want to love people and be loved but I can’t do either. Everyone around me seems so motivated but I’m just not. I feel lonely and angry and I don’t know where I’ve gone wrong. I’m an average teenager but I feel like such an outlier. I like MMA, weight lifting, gaming, anime, sports, and cars, yet I still feel like I have nothing to connect with people over. I always feel like the person I’m talking to isn’t a peer, but is always someone so much better than me or someone I look down on with disdain because they act like the me that got made fun of more and couldn’t keep that veil of indifference on. I think those kids are cringey and weird but I used to be like them, and a part of me is still like that, though I can’t show anybody. I still try to be nice to them, but not because I care about how they feel. I would just feel bad being mean if that makes sense. 
 
Sorry this post is so unorganized, but I have a lot going through my head and I’m barely keeping together the image of a chilled out guy who doesn’t care what people think while I’m secretly hoping they don’t think negative about me. I know I’m a giant hypocrite and I feel bad about it but I’m just stuck in a cycle of what feels like narcissism and self loathing. (Another weird point but I hate when people self diagnose and claim these things about themselves to be quirky, yet I do the same thing.) I view myself as better than others in so many ways yet feel like I’m something worthless in comparison most of the time. I just feel unimportant. I don’t feel happy around other people but feel lonely and sad in their absence. I don’t feel the type of love I used to towards my family and it scares me that I feel less and less connected to them, to the point they feel further away from me than most of my friends. I’m trapped wanting to not be alone but not feeling anything when I have people with me and I hate it.

Even now I’m trying my best not to sound cringey on this post and it’s just coming out as a mess. Again, sorry for the poor structure, I normally am decent at writing, but I’m just having a hard time painting what my life is like without trying to sound super self pitying or like I’m trying to be quirky. Not good with articulating my feelings as this is the only place where I’ve ever told people how I feel. It’s easier to tell people who I will never see or have to face.

For me, every time a bad incident ends, I try my best to look up and look positively. Then, things go downhill worse than ever and I am bound to go back to my negative hell hole depression again. 

Hell, it even feels like God or whatever universe is also laughing at me. One time I literally calmed myself down and prayed for right things to be sent my way, and the very exact moment my phone buzzes and I receive a text by the biggest narcissistic asshole who messed with me for over a month. Note that this person had lovebombed and it was extremely tough for me to cut him off back then, and they had not contacted me for over six months by that time. But the moment I made that prayer.. OMG! And this is not even a one time occurence. It happens everytime I try to look up. People tell you to change your affirmations and beliefs.. but the more I affirm the more things begin to go the opposite way. it's like I can't fight this whole depression thingy.

WOrst part? I know I am not an inherently negative person. That is, given my situations, I am pretty optimistic. Also, No meds or talk therapy ever improved it for me, but what did improve it for me were the change in situations. Had I been in better situations, or had my life even been a 50:50 for bad and good luck, I'd be in a way better sphere mentally.

1jqzmvw,2025-04-04 01:06:12,depression,Over a decade's worth of exhaustion,"I am almost 24 years old, and I am beginning to realize my mental health issues including my depression is not something that goes away on its own more into my adulthood. I have experienced depressive episodes since the age of 11. 

Today I feel defeated because I am so tired of my symptoms. I feel embarrassed because I experience crying fits for seemingly no reason some days. I am ashamed that I wake up in the morning with a sense of existential dread even on days that should be deemed not stressful or good. I have thoughts of harming myself and the idea everything would be better if I was no longer around. I cannot get up some days to do my necessary activities of daily living. It is extremely difficult for me to maintain relationships with new people and even people I care about because my depression puts up a cloudy barrier that is hard to see through to connect with others. Anhedonia feels like the worst thing in the world because what do you mean I can no longer do the things I used to love with my loved ones and feel joy from it?

I have experienced these symptoms for years, and some days I question if it has gotten worse. I have tried a handful of therapists and medications, but nothing seems to keep as the right fit for either. When I was younger, I was told by my family that it is just ""growing pains"" and ""puberty"". Sure, maybe some of it might have been, but I realize now I am stuck with a mood disorder and other fucked up mental issues that will affect me for the rest of my life. It makes me scared because I think to myself what type of life is worth living if I have to keep battling this until I die. I am tired, so so tired. 

Maybe things will get better, but I cannot say for certain because I do not know the future. For now I am here miserable, trying to work my way out of this mess. I am here to vent and maybe make someone else feel less alone in this battle while trying to feel less lonely myself. My support goes out to all who feel similar. A lot of people will never truly understand and sometimes shame you for this disorder. I don't want to live with shame or like this anymore.

Yes, there are meds and stuff, but absolutely all of them treat the symptom. They are notngoing to get you cured, they will just make you feel better for a while.

After that is a matter of trying new things to deal with the emotion until you, one day, are able to understand what the fuck is happening to you.

Is that it?",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jqwi3p/let_me_get_this_straight/
1jqg6n4,2025-04-03 11:42:07,depression,Did I irreversibly fuck up?,"Hello! My husband and I have been together for about 10 years. He’s been depressed on and off throughout the time, but recently it’s hit a point where I’ve never seen him at. On Monday he was so close to attempting to end it all. In the end he decided against it and we didn’t really talk about it further. We see the same therapist, so I told him he will be coming with me to my session on Wednesday. I had texted the therapist before giving her a heads up about what happened. We came up with a plan for how to discuss it in therapy. On the ride over my husband was begging me not to tell her, saying it will ruin everything and our relationship will never be the same. The thing is, he doesn’t know that I already told her. And that I need to speak about it with someone. It’s not fair to me to make me hold in all of that to myself. I thought therapy went fine— we made a safety plan and talked about IOPs (just as a step— not necessarily to go) and the therapist swore she would not be calling EMS today. He was quiet in the session but I thought he was fine. 

Turns out I was dead wrong. The second we got into the car to go home he kept yelling at me saying how badly I betrayed him. How I ruined his life. How I just couldn’t keep my mouth shut. He was saying some really cruel things. I kept apologizing and explaining my point of view. He says I have ruined the relationship. He says he still loves me but he’s disgusted by how I couldn’t keep my mouth shut and do the one thing he asked me to do— not tell the therapist. He said we could have worked it out just the two of us and I have ruined the relationship. 

We slept in different rooms last night and he’s not speaking to me this morning. Was I wrong to tell our therapist? Going in I thought I’d rather him be mad at me than not, but I was trying to help him. He’s convinced his life is ruined now 
because his safety plan is on file. I’ve explained to him the only time EMS would be called after the safety plan is if he tries again, tells someone he tried, and then tells them he didn’t follow the safety plan. 

I love this man so much and I’ve been doing so much for the decade we’ve been together. Was it wrong for me to tell the therapist? I hope he will understand I did it out of love and care for him. I feel so lost and I am afraid I ruined my marriage by telling the therapist. 

EDIT: in the past he’s spoken to me constantly about how he wants to end it all and how he wants to die. We normally have a conversation between us about this. On Monday it was to a level I’ve never seen before. He had a plan and ideation. And for the therapist, we see the same therapist both individually and as a couple. So texting her was me reaching out to my OWN therapist because I was lost and didn’t know what to do. ",22,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jqg6n4/did_i_irreversibly_fuck_up/

My chest hurts so bad but yet I stay silent & don’t do anything about it because it physically feels like I can’t move, i feel frozen.

1jr2ejp,2025-04-04 03:30:09,depression,I deserve everything bad that happens to me.,"I’m 25 and my life has been nothing but a series of unfortunate events. I’ve blocked out most of my life starting from age 1 to probably 22. At least so far.

There have only been maybe a small handful of times I’ve ever been happy. 

My motto is “fake it till you make it” but I can’t do that with my happiness. 

I’ll never be happy. Everything and everyone I ruin. 

I had what I thought was the perfect relationship and I ruined it because I’m depressed and anxious all the time. Yesterday, he let his coworkers steal his cellphone and harass me for several hours while I went into a full nervous breakdown. I deserved it. 
 
Everything in my life just goes wrong. I deserve it all. I’m probably the shittiest human to walk to earth. 

Everyone hates me. I don’t know why but I probably deserve it. 

Where is the happiness at the other side? I’ve searched and searched and come up empty handed for 25 fucking years. When will I get my perfect ending? Never.

I have no friends, no support system, my parents tell me they love me but then turn around and tell me I’m a piece of shit and a failure. But, I deserve it.

Everywhere I go this curse follows me. It just must be what my fate is. 

No amount of SSRI’s and therapy will fix it. I probably take over 200mg of SSRI’s a day. Nothing. Just emptiness. 

I’m just a severely broken and traumatized person and that’s all I’ll ever amount too. 

There is no future for me. There is no one out there who will love me for me. There is no one out there who will be my friend. Everyone leaves. Or they forget about me. But I deserve it.

Every day is a living hell. I suffer in silence every day and I deserve every fucking second. 

People only love you unless you’re pretty, dying (or already gone), or famous. And I’m none of those. 

I don’t know why I’m a bad person but I know I am because everything/everyone leaves me or hurts me in the end. 

In the end, it’ll always just be me, myself and I endlessly suffering because I did something to deserve it.

There is no happiness or love at the end of my book. Just this horrible, horrible curse written on every single page.",1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jr2ejp/i_deserve_everything_bad_that_happens_to_me/

I liked reading, playing games, playing with my pets, talking to my friends. It was fun and nice and I felt like I was living in the moment. I was paying attention in school and getting good grades. Within the past year or so, something just shifted. It started with me in a slump. I thought ""Oh everyone has these, I'll get over it soon."" and I didn't. Then I thought it was just seasonal depression, and it wasn't. Everyday day, the things that I used to enjoy doing bring me that same joy. I can't sit through movies, shows, games, homework, classes, or even talk to friends without feeling like nothing is clicking with me. I've tried so many things, I've tried getting on my devices more, I've tried staying away from them more. I've tried talking to only my closest friends daily, I tried talking to a lot of people online daily. Nothing is what I do every day anymore, just because I can't find joy in anything. Nothing is fun and I don't know why. I was doing pilates before, I had a nice daily schedule that I followed. I don't know what it is, maybe I need a strict routine back in my life.

1jr26dn,2025-04-04 03:18:06,depression,I don't know what to do anymore,"To give detail, I am 16 years old and I am a cis gendered male. My entire life I have experienced nothing but hardships, and obviously that's nothing to cry over, everyone experiences difficulties. It's a part of life, but my struggles to me are major because of how sensitive I am to such things that aren't meant for an adolescent or child to experience so soon. 

I have ADHD, but this wasn't known until august of last year after I decided to get diagnosed. My entire life, I have had struggles functioning up to social standards, and with no surprise also academical standards. For the most part, I can remember growing up always feeling as if I was failing, or as if I was doing something wrong, as if something was wrong with me. I had behavior issues, difficulty focusing on my necessities and tasks. According to my teachers, I was a disobedient and misbehaving child who just needs to learn to sit still and pay attention more. But those such things weren't even of my control, my ADHD had been taking effect of almost everything in my life. Talking to my ADHD specialist about my childhood experience, she was saddened and surprisingly shocked to hear my fully detailed experience, and had mentioned on how she wondered how in the world no one detected the possibility of me having ADHD.

The effects of my ADHD took place up through all of elementary, middle school and even my freshman year. And I can remember every single detail, bad, good, painful, and even agonizing. Not to mention how my anxiety (which my psychiatrist diagnosed me) made everything so much worse for my mental health and performance. I had severe depression and still do unfortunately.

Another thing to add is how I was subject to so much trauma growing up. Memories of my mother abusing me because of my father's mistakes, and how they would argue and become violently constantly, or memories of my older siblings just getting into the worst altercations with my parents. There is so much I could tell but I want to spare the details to focus on how the main thing is, my trauma, life experience, mental illnesses have effected me so god damn severely in my life, and even after being medicated and trying to make myself better. Nothing feels like it's working.

I haven't cried in a month but today just sitting at my dining table watching the sunset, I cried remembering every single word that has been said to me, every single thought that kills me, and every single memory that made me miserable. 

I'm wondering when I'll finally live, not be a failure, not be so irritated towards others, or when I'll finally complete my homework when I need to. There's so much damn thought and desire that I have, I am just so tired, I am so tired of living and practically making my mental and physical healthy works with caffeine and nicotine, as well as isolating myself from everyone.

I have lost all joy in everything I do, I have lost every bit of interest or hope that I have of living well and normally. I want to commit self harm so badly, but I'm tired of being ridiculed and judged for it. I want to do so much, and I want so much to go away. I just want to know, when will everything get better??? 

When in the fuck will I finally be a normal human being and not be the way I am, I want to be someone new and I've been trying so hard, but yet even what I try hard is never enough, I want things to be fine, I want everything I could ever hope for from myself to actually happen.

I want to live. I want to live, that is all I want, because for the past 16 years of my damned life, I've been dead.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jr26dn/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/

1jr1mhu,2025-04-04 02:48:43,depression,My chance of life was ruined,"Everyday every single day sometimes for hours I can't stop mourning the life I could've had.

I was smart, used to get As and Bs before highschool. I used to draw daily and I wanted to be a comic book artist. Reading books used to be my passion, I would read everyday and would still find time for other hobbies.

I hate my family for taking away the life I could've had. If it weren't for the abuse I wouldn't be suffering from Depression and PTSD. My anxiety is so bad that I constantly shake. After Covid is when it all went down hill, even when Covid settled down I refused to go back to school in person. It was such a a mistake. The isolation made my social anxiety worst. I was bed ridden for who knows how long, could've been a few months or even almost 2 years. I can't tell, I slept my life away, was too terrified to leave my room or even get from under my covers.

When I went back to school for my senior year, I had to spend most of my time in the counseling loft. Being around people would make me panic, I remember I burst out of the classroom crying. All my friends either moved schools or we no longer talked. I had only one person to talk to. I was so ashamed of being alone I refused to eat lunch in the cafeteria so people wouldn't see me eating alone. I skipped lunch and just sat in the counselors office. Starting medication as my senior year helped only a little. 

I'm permentatly mentally fucked up for the rest of my life. 

I suffer from existentialism and DPDR. Nothing feels real anymore. I can see, but at the same time I can't. The world feels fake, like the Truman show. It's horrifying. 

Then this person who I thought was my friend harassed me about my sexuality. They used to make comments towards me that made me uncomfortable. They never respected my boundaries when I told them there were things I didn't want to talk about due to my abuse. They didn't care. I still stayed friends with them because I was desperate for human connection.

It came to a point where they would make uncomfortable comments towards me and belittled me and degraded me so much that I just yelled at them. They blocked me because I was yelling at them and I just spiraled. I was yelling because I was upset that they were never listening to me. I'm so embarrassed. Why did I spam them for weeks, I should've just let it go. Why did I keep apologizing. Why did I say I send a gun picture saying I'd kill myself to them after they blocked me? And before you say I was threatening suicide (maybe I was, I was so out of it I don't even know what my intentions were) , I already talked to them about being suicidal and talked about that I wantrd to die even when we talked. I guess in my mind at the time when I was losing my shit and sent that I thought because they gave me permission to say those things when we were still talking that I justified it in my head that they didn't care if I said it. I don't like that but I know I did wrong. I feel guilty and horrible for it. 

I warned them that I would lose it if they wouldn't respect the things I didn't want to talk about but I fucking hate myself for being so god damned stupid. I don't interact with people much so I didn't realize how far I'd gone.  

And now this person keeps trying to get people online to block me. It won't stop happening and it's been two years. They don't tell people that they harassed me first either. Recently this person who was supposed to commission me blocked me because I blocked them temporarily for space. The person told them about me, and now they constantly seek my accounts to find me. I've been feeling so depressed because of it. I'm now haunted even more for acting stupid when I was an out of isolation 18 year old.

I can't even be happy I got my job. I can't stop thinking about people hating me. People stalking my accounts. My parents yelling at me and calling me names. Recently my mom kicked me outside in the snow in my pajamas because I started screaming after she was bullying me.

I'm so fucked. My brain is so far gone. I'm basically a corpse at this point. I'm on autopilot. No longer can feel happy. I don't have a sense of identity. I hate myself so much I can't even look in the mirror. I've gained weight and become fat. 

It's over. I'll never be able to recover. I make such stupid mistakes. I start to feel like my family was right to abuse me and hit me.

I'll never be able to get into a good college. I'll never achieve my dreams of becoming an artist. I'll never get married. I'll never.

I wish I could kill myself but I can't. My life is pointless. At this point, I am a walking zombie devoid of emotion who sticks to a routine to live the rest of my life. ",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jr1mhu/my_chance_of_life_was_ruined/

In comparison to the majority of people on this platform, my condition is most likely not even worth mentioning, quite frankly, since it isn't that bad, but I still wanted to get an outside perspective.

Generally speaking, I am not concerned about attempting self-harm or committing suicide currently. At least, not yet. My mental health is deteriorating, so it might worry me in the foreseeable future, but I have so far never gotten any thoughts of harming myself or ending it all. 
 Please offer me advice or opinions on what to do moving forward.

Here are my symptoms:

Excessive guilt, Reminiscing the past, Lack of motivation, Overthinking, Binge eating, Always tired, Intrusive thoughts, Low self-esteem, Highly sensitive to criticism or anything deemed less than perfect, and Easily tearful.

Hormones and stress are also causes for some of these, not just depression, but I believe there is at least a somewhat correlation between these signs and my worsened depression.

At the end of the day, I am just a kid trying to fix my issue before adulthood arrives, so any assistance or support y'all can offer is much appreciated by me.

The most effect they had on me was at the start when Sertralin zombiefied me. That effect wore off and they've been giving me new medications to try.

But nothing works. I try to force myself to think positive but  something chemical rejects it. My moods always swing very extremely which has cost me some friendships.

I also have diagnosed autism which may/may not be related.

So far I have been on:

Sertralin

Citalopram

Propranalol

Fluoxetine (currently trialing these)

Out of desperation I've also been trying weed, which is better for late night anxiety and helping sleep than depression. Likewise Xanax, which I managed to get some.

It just feels like nothing works, I'm not getting younger, my emotional state prevents me from having healthy/lasting relationships. My doctor(s) just draw everything out and request patience with each ineffective medication.

I dealt with stupid girls who I thought were my friends growing up, and I think that messed me up. I was funny, I talked a lot, I was an A student. 
Today happened something that left me open mouthed: (note that I'm now a grown woman) some teen girl was laughing behind me on the train, saying to her friend: let me see if the gorilla gives me way. I'm a thin and tall, good-looking woman. It's just my arms that are a bit hairy, and I sweat a lot due to anxiety. I couldn't keep it to myself, and I started mimimiing her as she walked away. If people are like this to strangers, how do they treat their peers? It's disgusting. I was on a crowded train going to work, but this girl felt so comfortable in her little fckin cage.

When I was a teen, I was respectful, kind, and smart, and unfortunately, I didn't respond to mean girls. I just cried alone in my room. Now I feel rage, and i say whatever I have to say without reservations.
I hate people who hate on other people, I've always gotten along with everyone and helped those in need.
Now, I fear most people, and my social life is a mess. 
It's not just teens, grown ass women make fools out of themselves too by doing this, and I don't have the energy for that behaviour: that says a lot about them. If people feel like they can do this, their life must be harder than mine, and they must have a deeper mental illness that they're too proud to admit. 
I used to be just a sad girl, but now I'm a sad and furious woman...
I've always loved culture and literature and reading the classics, but I don't have the nerve to be a teacher since I hate teens, and I guess I would just lose my mind. I'm at a tech job where I don't have to deal with people, but it's too robotic and definitely not my field (invoice quality). 
Everywhere I look, I see self-centered people who are judgemental and don't really care for each other. Is it just my depression? Where are the kind, smart, funny, and loving people?
My depression gets worse because there are no kind people in my life, or if there are, I don't get to see them or talk to them as much, and my job is so pointless and voided. I write poetry and draw because it's cathartic.
And I'm not that sad for me, I'm sad for the fact that we need to do this to each other, the root to everything we do and say, and I think about the meaning of all of this on a philosophical way, about human nature, and that everything is so pointless, you know?

I’d love to hear your advice and experiences regarding something important because I have rare disease :(. And I feel awful!!!😞
The sertraline always works well for me. 
I’ve been taking it since I was 16 (25 mg)

Quick background: 
• I switched from 50 mg (2 month) to 75 mg of sertraline tablets. I’m now in week 5, with the upper dose and I’m really not doing well. 
• I have enteroptosis (bowel prolapse) and IBS, and because of that, my intestinal motility is also impaired. 
• It’s very likely that the medication is not being properly absorbed.

My diagnose: 
Generalized anxiety with depressive episodes 

My question: Has anyone with IBS found that the liquid version of Zoloft (sertraline) worked better? That’s what I’m about to try now with my doctor. I’m really scared — but hopeful too.

Im desperately looking for help if anybody else has ever had these relatable symptoms & could please help me to find out what i might have developed. i really dont know if its depression related or really bad anxiety? i just know for sure that i have something & i have been battling this for a few years with no medical help, i was totally unaware until recently a few times i noticed that drinking alchohol & smoking weed was making me feel normal? then after my body sobered up my mind went back to being in a depressed state. 

most of the time i feel like im just existing & not truly living it also feels like being stuck in a day dream & being a spectator in my own life, its crazy.

1jqx55w,2025-04-03 23:07:39,depression,I'm being eaten alive,"
My name is Elizabeth. I’m 18 years old. Normally, I don’t share my name online, especially on Reddit, because I know too many people who use it. But I’m exhausted. Not just physically, but mentally, emotionally. I feel like I’m being swallowed whole by something I can’t escape and atp this is my last cry for help. 

I grew up in an abusive home. My parents don’t love each other, and I don’t think they love me either, not in the way they’re supposed to at least. My dad and younger brother mock me for my ADHD, like it’s some kind of joke. No matter what I do for them, no matter how much I try, it never feels like enough. And yet, I keep trying. I keep hoping that maybe, just once, they’ll treat me like I matter. But they don’t. They never do.

I wish it were different with my friends. But it’s not. I call them my friends, but I don’t know if I’m really theirs. I’m always the one listening, the one helping, the one being there when they need someone, but when it’s me who needs them, it feels like I’m just background noise. I can sit right next to them, be in the middle of a conversation, and still feel completely alone. It’s like they like having me around, but they don’t really need me. 

For a little while, it wasn’t always this bad. I had a boyfriend, someone who shared my interests, someone who actually listened. And for the first time, it felt like I had someone who would notice if I wasn’t there. But he left. Said I was too distant. That I didn’t let him in. And maybe he was right. Maybe I don’t know how to let people stay. But it still hurt. And when he left, it felt like proof of what I’d been afraid of all along thatno matter how much I want to be close to people, I’ll always be the one standing on the outside, looking in.

Since then, I’ve started doing things I never thought I’d do. Things I’d be ashamed to admit. And the worst part is I don’t even know why. It’s just making my life worse. Now I can’t eat. I can’t sleep. And when I do sleep, I don’t want to wake up. I used to care about school, about my future. I got into so many colleges, and I should be excited. But I don’t even have the energy to move anymore. 

I don’t want to die. But I don’t know how to keep living like this. It’s like my body is shutting down, like my mind is breaking apart, and I don’t know how to stop it. I want to believe there’s something out there for me like a reason to keep going. But right now, I just feel empty. Like I’ve already disappeared, and no one even noticed.

1jqx3yp,2025-04-03 23:06:11,depression,I don’t feel like I’m a good person,"I’ve had up-and-down depressive episodes ever since I was a kid. I live in a country where mental health is severely stigmatized and it’s very difficult to get antidepressant medication without judgment or professional consequences (i could lose my job) . lately. I’ve been trying to join a gym and exercise to try to improve my energy and mental health, but I just feel like I’m constantly sabotaging and ruining good things for myself. I get trapped in a negative spiral, and I just wonder if I’m doing this because morally I’m not a good person and I don’t feel like I deserve good things so I just ruin it and punish people around me

My boyfriend and I went on a date to go look at some flowers and I got angry at him because I wanted to leave right when he got home, but he kept stalling and joking and acting like he didn’t wanna go because there were too many people , which made me feel like he thinks its a chore to spend time with me. we went to go take pictures and he teased me for taking bad pictures of him, and that just kind of set me into like a negative spiral which ruined the entire day. I don’t know why I do this. I feel like i’m constantly punishing others with my negative thoughts and I’m just a bad person to be around. My boyfriend pretty much said as much yesterday and that maybe I should just accept that I’m a shitty person. I really don’t know what I’m doing here and I’m kind of just word vomiting right now, but he shamed me for getting therapy so I canceled it yesterday. I started self harming about a month ago which I haven’t done since middle school and I think about hanging myself maybe six or seven times a day.  

I don’t feel like I can call the suicide hotline here because I worry that they will keep my phone number and report it to my job or something. So I guess I’m just here looking for some support or something.

1jqw5og,2025-04-03 22:24:24,depression,I feel like a ghost ever since I stopped going to school.,"Hi. I'm Titania and I was a graduating student. Ever since I stopped going to school this semester, it feels like everyone—except my boyfriend—has stopped acknowledging my existence. I don’t know if I’m overreacting, but it really hurts.

Growing up, I was an overachiever—getting gold medals, excelling in sports, journalism, math—I was basically the “golden child.” I’ve been through a lot in these past 19 years, and this school year became my breaking point. I was diagnosed with BPD, dysthymia, and more.

Since I stopped going to school, my dad hasn’t been as communicative as he used to be. He even stopped sending me allowance. I feel neglected as his daughter. 
My mom constantly reminds me that I’m going to fail because of all this. They only talk to me when it’s about how I’m “wasting time and money” by “taking a break.” They believe mental illness is just part of “God’s plan” or that it’s a choice. They’re not open to understanding what I’m going through.

It hurts so much, because these were the same people who once made me feel loved and adored. Now, I feel like a ghost around them, especially when I’m at my lowest.

I don’t have friends anymore either. They cut me off after deciding I was “helpless.” They told me they were tired of how I always said no to plans, and that I was selfish for being “sad all the time.” But I can’t help it—I’m suffering. I don’t know what to do, or who to talk to.

I also hate myself for feeling miserable when I see my boyfriend getting busy. I really am proud of him and I support him—but it still hurts to watch everyone else move on with their lives while I feel stuck and broken. I know it’s a “me” problem, but I can’t shake it.

My therapist just keeps giving me medication. It helps with anxiety and sleep, but not much else. I feel like suicide is the only choice left… even though I still have so many dreams.",0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jqw5og/i_feel_like_a_ghost_ever_since_i_stopped_going_to/

That my struggles and battles for so many years are just going to get worse and that there's no point in trying anymore. I'm a christian struggling with faith and belief. Doubts absolutely ruin my mind and trust in God and I feel like my world is falling apart. Left my job 2 weeks ago to pursue a career I thought was going to be the permanent job that I had found my calling. But then it didn't work out and a day later I had to resign. Now I have no job and no hope for my future. I've been applying to jobs but only have gotten 2 calls back for places I really don't want to work for. I've got nearly 30 applications sent out. 1 place is a complete mystery on if they'll even hire me and has been really hard to get ahold of. I'm  23 will be 24 in July and have looked at my entire life as a complete failure. My dad around my age had my brother and got married to my mom. I look at my brother and he's 30 found his girlfriend who is now his wife nearly 10 years ago. Then there's me. A complete failure compared to all of them. No job, no girlfriend, severe depression, anxiety, adhd, and no confidence in myself that it's just want my pain to end. Still stuck at home cant afford to move out. I've been in some dark battles with depression before but this one is really beating me down. I've had suicidal thoughts before but this in a way feels different. I zoned out today for minutes maybe just fantasizing about ending my life. Putting a gun in my mouth and blowing my brains out. Then it was thoughts of overdosing on something and hoping I'd just fall asleep and die. Finally I snapped out of it because I was playing a game at the time trying to relax and a explosion in the game scared me so much it made me snap back into reality. I realized how zoned out and focused I was on the thought of my own death it was disturbing yet in a way comforting. Then it's guilt because as much as I want to do it I feel terrible for leaving my family, friends and dogs behind. Yet I suffer so much daily it feels like I just can't keep going and that i just need to end it. My mental health just seems to get worse with age even with medicine. Can't afford to go to therapy even when I had a job because my insurance is awful. Mental health needs to be taken more seriously because of what it does to us who struggle with it.

He was the first man I loved. I think I will only love him.

I miss him so much...everything reminds me of him.  I can't move forward, I don't think I want to.

He was so important. I was finally me. I was finally able to express my love to him after all this time. Whole hours on the phone. Our looks spoke for us. These songs to indirectly tell each other that we love each other. It was stronger than me. Much too strong not to imply something to him. I thought I was dreaming the night we kissed. This love made me discover a sensation that I did not know. I would have done anything for him. I had seduced a heterosexual.

When I looked at him, it was obvious. I wanted it for my whole life. I had never felt like that.

But I'm not a girl...

I want to cry in his arms, tell him I'm sorry. Sorry for not being up to the task.

Sorry for being me...

I will never forget that day he left me. That day when he turned his back on me forever. That day when he said those hurtful words. That day when we were torn apart. I don't want to believe it happened.

*Damn it’s hard*

Hard not to see a message from him - Hard to no longer hear the sound of his voice - Hard to no longer laugh at our stupidities - Hard to no longer feel his hand - Hard to no longer wake up with him - Hard to have 
his sweater - Hard to have to forget it.

Life is so cruel and I have to tell myself that *that's how it is*, 14 years of my life that remain only memories.

1jqh6sq,2025-04-03 12:31:50,depression,Sister has depression and isn’t seem to be getting better,"Hi everyone, I’m in need of advice. My sister has been on depression medicine for the past ~6 months and has been in therapy for about 2-3 months. She doesn’t talk to her family too much and even when I try to ask her questions, the best she does is short answers and usually just doesn’t want to talk too much. She has told me she feels better but said it with a lot of thought and I just feel like she told me that because that’s what I wanted to hear. She says she likes her therapist but idk if the therapy is HELPING her. Liking your sessions is different from finding them helpful and idk if the therapist is suggesting her things to do that might help her manage her depression and anxiety better. I don’t get much from my sister about her sessions. Should I press a bit more or can I request her therapist to meet with me to get a better idea of my sister’s health?
The medicine is what is bothering me the most. I definitely slacked as a sister to check up on that. I’m only now finding out that 2 months is when you should probably start seeing an improvement. She’s meeting with another doctor about her medicines soon. She has thyroid problems too so I’m not sure how that’s playing together. She told me both her psychiatrist and endocrinologist know what medicines she’s on but to me it feels like they know but they haven’t really considered how these medicines might be working for her. I don’t want to discredit professionals but I feel very frustrated at everyone because I see my sister suffering. 
She picks up and gets over hobbies/activities quickly and doesn’t stick to one thing for long. That to me is one of the telltale signs that she isn’t doing well. She had been going walking and biking in Feb but stopped in March.

1jqdoqn,2025-04-03 09:11:20,depression,"I am a Failure, by every definition of it.","For the last three years, I’ve been stuck in a cycle of procrastination, avoidance, and self-doubt. I kept telling myself I would change, that I would get serious, that I had time. But I didn’t. Time ran out. I failed a major exam—one I can’t retake. No second chances, no redemption, just failure staring me in the face.

Right now, I feel like I’ve thrown away years of my life. I had ambitions, big ones. I wanted to be disciplined, to push myself, to win. But instead, I let fear control me. I avoided the hard work. I wasted days, weeks, months, thinking “I’ll do it tomorrow.” Now there’s no tomorrow for this exam. Just the realization that I didn’t fight hard enough.

The worst part? I didn’t even give it my all. I didn’t fail because I tried my hardest and fell short—I failed because I was a coward. I let laziness, fear, and distraction dictate my actions. I ignored reality until it was too late. And now, I’m left with regret.

And honestly? It’s eating me alive. I’ve had suicidal thoughts because of this. I feel like I don’t deserve to keep going after wasting so much time. But at the same time, there’s still a small part of me that wants to fight, that wants to fix this and never let it happen again.

For those of you who’ve been in a place like this—where you’ve wasted years and had to rebuild from rock bottom—how did you do it? How do you go from being a lazy, inconsistent mess to someone who actually executes every single day? How do I make sure I never, ever end up here again?

I’ve been abused twice-once by a neighbour when I was a kid and again by someone I was seeing when I was around 20 yo.

I’ve suffered with my self-esteem,not physically but of who I am inside as a person,never thought someone could really like me. Overcame that and things became easier. But my depression always come back and the feeling of ending it becomes more often.

I’m lucky to have amazing friends,that truly care about me. But my life feels empty and without a purpose. My job is shit for about a year and I don’t know what I can do to get things better,plus I don’t have a degree. I get paid fairly well,but not constant as I’m a freelancer.

I’ve had awful relationships throughout my whole life,besides the abuses,I had an alcoholic dad who used to beat me and wished I was a boy. Never received love from him and together with the other things I believe that lead to getting involved with men who were not good to me. I’m an attractive woman,get looks but no one seems to want to have anything serious with me besides sex. I’m at the age were all my friends are getting married,forming their family and I’m alone,I’m never someone’s first choice to have something more,is all about lust.

1jqgv69,2025-04-03 12:16:11,depression,feeling shattered,"M22 T1D

i went through a lot. recently ive been having issues. 

I learned how to code at age 12 (and didn't stop). I've had lots of breakthroughs in other areas of my life. I was that nerdy kid that really never spoke to others because of strong fear and constantly comparing myself to others. 

Something I've learned about myself is that I'm incapable of having friends because of my trauma. I just think they're a waste of time entirely and they're only going to hurt me. I just feel a strong emotional hatred for people around me at all times. Like every little flaw ruins their entire character, and they'll never care about me. They don't care about themselves. ""They're just stupid."" I know its bad but I don't know how to fix it. 

I did have tons of online friends for awhile but I snapped and isolated myself one day in 2022 and I haven't been the same since. 

The problem is that I've had massive anhedonia for life in general. 6 months ago I was able to play things like video games/tv shows, now I feel as if my time is entirely wasted even being on them for 20 minutes. Like the only thing that matters in my life is how much I can overwork myself. 

This has lead to a conflicted state. When I work I feel like I'm stabbing myself repeatedly and enjoying it at the same time. It feels great in the moment, but the second you let go, you immediately start feeling terrible. It's sort of like being in love with something that is incapable of loving you back.

I'll usually end up in a psychotic state after working 7 days a week because I just get so fixated on what I enjoy doing. If I could live in an office with a bedroom I probably would. I think my past is hurting me more then I'd like, but I'd rather forget about my past.

My suicidal thoughts (and my thought disorder) have gotten a lot worse. I've always felt a very weak connection to life because of T1D. The thing is, I want to be deeply connected to this world. I just don't know how people are able to enjoy simpler things. The complex things I love a lot make thought disorder worse, while the easy to understand things become very boring and monotonous.

I feel like the emotional side of me has died. I'm not a psychopath because I still care, but the emotions I do have are entirely muted. I will feel them intensely but be unable to act on them. I'll feel angry but I won't even raise my voice. I'll just look at you and speak normally as if I'm hiding it. Like they still exist but I pretend they aren't there. 

I was wondering if anyone has any tips or ideas on how i could help myself, it's confused me a lot. I'm trying to make sense of how I can work through it.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jqgv69/feeling_shattered/

anyway, here goes: i have a very small fan account on twitter and i have this nice mutual on there. we're not friends and have barely interacted but i have wanted to be friends with her for a while. but she's depressed and i think even has some suicidal thoughts. when she posts those thoughts, some of her friends and even i try to leave positive/encouraging messages but well.. you guys probably already know that that's not all that helpful. even just a few hours ago, she posted something that read like suicidal ideation. i didn't really know what to say tbh. even generally i am not great at making conversation, but with heavy topics especially i often end up saying the wrong thing.   
  
so what i want to know is - should i try to reach out to her or leave her be? would she feel burdened if i dm'ed her out of nowhere? if i do message her, should i try to talk about our mutual interest or send her words of encouragement or something to that effect?  
  
disclaimer: please keep in mind that i'm only doing this for selfish reasons.. i just know we'd get along and i don't really have many friends i can talk to. i have no misconceptions that i can 'fix' her or even help her in any way because i have been depressed in the past as well. in fact i'm probably still a bit depressed but it's not that bad now.

At the same time, I suck at socializing. I am an introvert. I also feel bad when it seems like he enjoys someone else's company instead of mine. I want to be his favorite. I want to seem the prettiest in his eyes. 

But it's hard. I can't force myself to be confident. I think I'm stuck at this cycle. Even when I put effort to make myself pretty, other girls will always be prettier. And I hate that I'm too negative that I suck out the good vibes in the room.

I workout. I am very passionate. I do well in school. I am a kind person. But my sadness makes it all have no worth. An ex has left me for being too sad before. I feel like I'll forever think that I won't be enough and that I'll forever be sad.

I developed a illness that significantly impacted my weight and eating habits and for months I’ve been in a lot of pain. At the worst of it, I was extremely depressed and suicidal. I even set a date and made a plan to do it. But on the day of, I went out and really thought about everything. There was a lot I  still wanted to do so although I was so mentally and physically exhausted I just couldn’t go through with it. 

I ended up telling my mom about how I had been feeling. I haven’t opened up to her since I was a kid. And the second I told her I realised why I stopped opening up to her. She got really disappointed at me when I told her I was feeling suicidal. Which kind of made me feel even worst than I already did.

So, I just started trying things on my own. I tried doing the things I love before. My illness has become more manageable with medication, so I tried doing things like watching the shows i used to love and trying to go outside, which is hard because its winter where I am. I tried applying for jobs again and I even reached out to my friend who I was very distant with because of the illness and the depression making me isolate myself. I tried talking to my family more too, I didn't open up to them again, but I tried talking casually about stuff. And for a while things where going well. 

But then the pain came back in different ways and I feel like my illness is changing or getting worst. My friend hasn't answered me in 2 weeks even though they have read my messages. And my family keep acting like I'm fine. They keep  forgetting that I'm sick and telling me to eat things and do stuff that they know I can't in my condition. And on top of all it, I just feel so fucking lonely. I know it's my own fault for isolating myself but I wish someone cared enough to not let me deal with this alone.

My thoughts have been spiraling and I'm started to get back to that low point I was at before. I keep thinking back and regretting not going forward with that suicide attempt. And it makes me feel so guilt because I wanted to try and get better. 

I thought I want getting better. But everytime I think things are going to work out I just get kicked down again. I'm so tired.

1jq8rlv,2025-04-03 04:00:07,depression,Can’t seem to break out of a depressive cycle,"***Disclaimer***: I’m not actively suicidal, and I started therapy recently. 

I never had the most financially secure childhood. I switched schools multiple times throughout my childhood for financial reasons and after being bullied. I feel like I became an incredibly reserved and anxious person because of it. I rarely made friends that stuck around. One friend group made me feel like I was too different, like there was something wrong with me. But I was too afraid to leave them because I didn’t want to be seen physically alone. I reverted to self harm because it gave me a physical outlet for all the overwhelming feelings I had. Once I was in high school, I was eating lunch alone in the hallways feeling extremely isolated from my peers. Being alone in school just makes you feel like there’s something wrong with you, you know? And you can’t figure it out, so you just assume that it is everything you are that is wrong. I started having extremely self destructive thoughts.

I made an attempt at getting help in high school. I told my mom about my anxiety and how unmanageable it had become for me. After an appointment she made, which costed us 100 bucks, I started thinking about how much it would cost just to get therapy. So I refused to go because I didn’t want to be a financial burden to my mom. Especially not after we almost lost our house after the 2008 recession, not after she’d been the only person supporting us financially since my childhood, and not since we didn’t have health insurance. 

It also doesn’t help when you grew up with an alcoholic, absent father who gave no fucks about you as a child and emotionally abused you for his own benefit. Doesn’t even help now when his organs are paying the price for his addiction and he hasn’t changed and has no fucking clue why you won’t talk to him anymore. 

I don’t have a large friend group now. I spend the majority of my week alone. I go to class, then go home, that’s all. When I have ideas and want to do things to get out of the house, I’m too afraid to do them alone and when I ask the people in my life and I get told “I’m too busy” or “not now”, I feel like locking myself in my room and crying myself to sleep. I feel like the kind of person people in life go to when their first choices aren’t available for them. I feel like I’m only useful to people when they don’t want to be alone, not because they want to spend time with me. I feel like the only me people care to see is the one that is happy. I don’t feel good enough. I don’t feel like I matter. I frequently find myself daydreaming about leaving my hometown, and being on my own in another city. I just want to not feel lost anymore. I want to belong, I want to feel truly accepted and loved for all good and for all the fucked up that I am.

I find myself always returning to these thoughts when I feel depressed…always. I don’t know how to move past it. The craziest thing is that once I’m able to get past the lowest points, I feel like I was overreacting until the cycle starts all over again.

After all this venting, I just want to know what kinds of things have helped to anchor you down when you feel depressive thoughts trying to pull you down? How do you break out of this cycle? Has anyone been in a similar situation who’s been able to move past it? Any input is appreciated.

Nothing in my life changed. I’m still in the same situation. But now, with no sleep, I don’t feel like I’m suffocating. My brain feels messed up from the bad sleep schedule, sure—but mentally, I’m okay. Still no real motivation, but I feel peaceful. No rumination. It's also easier to get things done.

Why is that? What’s the link between sleep deprivation and this temporary “clarity” or peace?

This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

I can barely look in mirrors anymore without feeling disgusted. I want plastic surgery to fix my biggest flaws but I know I'll still hate myself. I'm so ugly, my face is unfixable. I hate this. I hate the fact that I'll probably die alone cause I'm the last option. It's ruining my life and I'm not sure how long I can keep going. I want to rip my face off. It's caused me depression, social anxiety and so many other issues.

I posted in the plastic surgery sub and everyone tells me not to have any. It doesn't make sense. It's a plastic surgery sub. I hate when people lie to me. I just want acceptance, not pity. Yet everyone lies to me.

1jr2ist,2025-04-04 03:36:39,SuicideWatch,I Need Advice To Keep Going,"Written by a 14 year old, I prefer to keep my identity a secret as anyone from my school or who know me might stumble upon this and start to worry about me. This was originally suppose to be a journal of my life, but it turned into some personal stuff.

Currently, I'm in 8th grade. I'm pretty down right now since I got my measurements wrong on my piece of wood in Tech Ed class, so I have to now buy a new piece of wood to fix it or I'll fail the class. I don't really wanna ask my dad to go and buy me some wood just for a stupid class, but I have no choice. My health class is also pretty boring. We started a health project about creating a “healthy” restaurant. The food that we wanna add has to have food labels and details of why it's good, better, or best. My group partner doesn't really do shit for every class. No wonder he's failing almost every class, plus his simple grammar sucks. After school, I came back depressed and pissed. Later at night, I have suicidal thoughts or thoughts about going in the army so my life doesn't go to a waste. I also want to care for my family, I just am too shy to express that I really do care about them and the things they do. This night, I shed tears of confusion and sadness. I don't know what to do with my life. My hopes are to find my purpose in high school. The suicidal thoughts and thoughts of just life in general keep popping up in my head. Atleast forward testing is done, so I don't have to overthink too much. I do wake up tired and am half awake at school. My reaction time is becoming slower due to my sleepiness. I'm also unfit and ugly with acne. Life is just this harsh sometimes. That's why I play games to escape reality. It's matters of what's in the game, not what's behind the monitor. I can probably get some agreements with that claim. If you're still reading, Thank you. If I ever stop writing, it's either that I've committed suicide or I've lost the will to live.

It's been about 10 minutes. I've calmed myself by watching YouTube shorts. After that, I tried to sleep, but I couldn't. The thoughts keep me awake. “What would happen if I die? The people that know me, what will my death trigger in them? Do they really care?” These kinds of thoughts keep coming back everyday. When I think about trying to kill myself, I picture seeing my whole family sobbing. I just can't see myself doing it if that thought keeps reaching out. “What purpose do I serve?” I ask myself. 

Life has shown the darkest of days for me. Brighter ones I hope will show. But as I'm at the bottom of despair, the light won't shine on me.

I've attempted to sleep again. Tears keep pouring off my face. I don't know what to do. It's not like I lost someone I know or love. But it really feels like a heartbreak. Eyes dry as the California forests, but were soaked like a rock under a waterfall not too long ago. I still don't know why im even having suicidal thoughts over school.

Please help me stand up again.

I am prescribed medication that I have crippling anxiety over taking. I want help for myself but I avoid it, I am helpless and can't get out of my own fucked up head. I DO NOT want to die as it's a big fear of my that I have not comes to terms with yet, but my brain is so imbalanced that's all it wants to think about. I hate it, I don't want help I just want someone to read this and tell me I'm not alone and that you have talked to someone who was probably in the same boat as me that has gotten help or tell me if you think it's too late and it's bound to happen? It's just a matter of when. I am that happy friend, I am that helpful friend, I'm the everybody needs her there to make everyone else comfortable friend. But where is mine? Why am I having to have all this weight of making people happy on my shoulders when I'm not even happy? I truly am scared for my mental health, I don't want to be this way. I don't want to die, I don't want to hurt myself but I just can't stop thinking. I don't even want to press send because I'm afraid of what you might do or who you'll send. I don't want help, I don't need help but I do. I'm tired of expressing my feelings to someone who brick walls and doesn't comfort and just flips it back on me then asked what I need.

1jqx94u,2025-04-03 23:12:23,SuicideWatch,I don’t feel like I’m a good person,"I don’t feel like I’m a good person

I’ve had up-and-down depressive episodes ever since I was a kid. I live in a country where mental health is severely stigmatized and it’s very difficult to get antidepressant medication without judgment or professional consequences (i could lose my job) . lately. I’ve been trying to join a gym and exercise to try to improve my energy and mental health, but I just feel like I’m constantly sabotaging and ruining good things for myself. I get trapped in a negative spiral, and I just wonder if I’m doing this because morally I’m not a good person and I don’t feel like I deserve good things so I just ruin it and punish people around me

My boyfriend and I went on a date to go look at some flowers and I got angry at him because I wanted to leave right when he got home, but he kept stalling and joking and acting like he didn’t wanna go because there were too many people , which made me feel like he thinks its a chore to spend time with me. we went to go take pictures and he teased me for taking bad pictures of him, and that just kind of set me into like a negative spiral which ruined the entire day. I don’t know why I do this. I feel like i’m constantly punishing others with my negative thoughts and I’m just a bad person to be around. My boyfriend pretty much said as much yesterday and that maybe I should just accept that I’m a shitty person. I really don’t know what I’m doing here and I’m kind of just word vomiting right now, but he shamed me for getting therapy so I canceled it yesterday. I started self harming about a month ago which I haven’t done since middle school and I think about hanging myself maybe six or seven times a day.  

I don’t feel like I can call the suicide hotline here because I worry that they will keep my phone number and report it to my job or something. So I guess I’m just here looking for some support or something.

It doesn't fit together the way we think it should. And that's fine. Sometimes (don't take this outta context), it's better that way. You don't have to figure it all out. Nobody does. And, honestly, I think that's the point. If we had all figured it out, wtf would be left of all of us??!?!??!? Where would be the tempted, curious humans we all are? 

You're perfect. Believe it. I don't care if you: have no talents, don't know how to cook things, can't write, can't work, have a disorder, have had bad experiences that make up you. You're sloppy, sure, we all are. Some more than others. But doesn't that feel perfect somehow? You're still a puzzle even if the pieces aren't fully together yet. You're still a puzzle even if you haven't put down one piece. 

If you're lonely, I'll be your friend. If you need assistance, I'm right here. 

I read Looking For Alaska the other day. It was really stupid as fuck but it was so beautiful, too! Here's something John Green wrote: When adults say, ""Teenagers think they are invincible"" with that sly, stupid smile on their faces, they don't know how right they are. We need never be hopeless, because we can never be irreparably broken. We think that we are invincible because we are. We cannot be born, and we cannot die. Like all energy, we can only change shapes and sizes and manifestations. They forget that when they get old. They get scared of losing and failing. But that part of us greater than the sum of our parts cannot begin and cannot end, and so it cannot fail.

1jr5j7a,2025-04-04 06:41:31,SuicideWatch,"Drop out of graduate school and join the army out of desperation, risking dying in it or killing yourself","Hello everyone. I have lived on this planet for 23 years and I have realized one thing. Life is absurd, cruel and unfair. All these childhood illusions have crumbled like a house of cards since my teenage years. Perhaps someone here has heard of ephilism or read such philosophers as Schopenhauer, Cioran, Liggotti, Mainländer. And now to the point. Now I am studying for a master's degree, I myself have completed my bachelor's degree in theology. At that time I was not free from all illusions, for some reason I tried, I was worried, in general, anxiety has accompanied me all my life. Let's not deny upbringing and genes, but also let's not deny an adequate rational reaction to a world in which everyone lies, consumes and lives in the illusions of stoicism and religious dogmatism. Also, in my country there are peculiar difficulties with education, finding a job, escaping from the army, etc. I am disappointed in literally everything.  The fifth year of higher education is exhausting, everywhere there is propaganda that you need to give birth, that you need to blindly believe in illusions, improve yourself. It did not lead me anywhere. I tried to forget by releasing music albums in the dsbm genre, I tried to live in a relationship, but this does not help me cope at all. Now I perceive education as a light version of the army, where you also need to humiliate yourself, write delusional notes and not get any output. I had the best diploma, but you know, it did not affect anything except false praise and the killing of my nerves. So. Now there is another senseless war. Naturally, I do not want to go to war. And I do not intend to kill anyone, besides, I am a vegan and mostly a pacifist since school. But I am so tired, afraid of work, afraid of uncertainty, running from the military registration and enlistment office, learning unnecessary bullshit.  I plan to go to the army for a year out of desperation, I heard many can't stand it and kill themselves or they die from abuse and stress. I myself have a heart defect from birth but the military registration and enlistment office didn't give a shit about it and I was the only one who was not given an exemption from service.

1jr0hty,2025-04-04 01:50:24,SuicideWatch,Everything that has led me to do this.,"I guess I ought to say something about this. It shall go into an abyss, and my voice won't be heard, but I've got nothing to lose.

I'm very shy and don't talk to many people, this is all just going on in my head, the loudest voice ever.

I have/had the gym to silence that voice but even that is starting not to work anymore.

I don't have a good relationship with my parents and I honestly don't even have the energy to explain this part, so I will just say, my mom is with my stepdad, and he is an absolute tool. There were moments when I was younger where I thought he was trying to sleep with me. He would make such strange comments, and I am at least thankful to be away from it now, but the few times I went to the gym with him, he would say things like ""those guys are staring at your a\*\*"", ""you're looking very fit, it's noticeable."" there was a point where he presented a $100 infront of me and told me to take my pants off. He walked by my window one night and I was getting dressed and didn't realize (I mean who would in the privacy of your own room) but he came to my door and he said he saw me naked and commented on my body and said.. I had a perky chest. He manipulates my mom as well, talks badly about her, spends more money on himself then he ever would her. He's been with her for most of my life, so around 13 years (Im 21 now as of last month). He could have married her long ago but his excuse, and my mom believes this.. there are marriage laws that say if you're with a person long enough you're legally married.. blah blah, but there is no ring, she allows herself to settle and is just as delusional as him. He won her years ago and she will take his side over mine any day, and now I understand why my grandma never liked him as well, it makes me sick that she doesn't listen to me.

But she doesn't know. She's blind to it.

Im like, shaking and wanting to cry just typing that.

My DAD I don't have a good relationship with either, because he doesn't even care about much of anything, he has never carried to visit me much and will always try to convince me that its my moms fault that we aren't closer.

I don't know how to talk to people. I focus on myself so much and I just wait for other people to come up to me and start conversation. I get overwhelmed and my head is so loud telling me that these people don't have good intentions and I won't find/keep real friends. Especially other girls, I don't have other girl friends, I have social media friends. No one ever wants to go and do anything or hang out, they are always too busy, and im in COLLEGE where there is so much opportunity to make new connections. But for some reason im still alone. And sometimes I think the problem is me.

I lost my job because of a stupid mistake I made. (My fault)

My mom is threatening to pull me out of college because my grades are falling apart. (My fault)

I literally spent a night in jail, and almost didn't make it out of that because mentally I couldn't handle it. (Obviously my fault)

I had a recent fling with a Viet guy and it was very back and forth as to whether it was going somewhere serious or not, but we were together CONSTANTLY.. multiple times a week, back to back nights........ and afterward I tried to act like it didn't bother me but it did, it made me cry. I forget having emotions is normal but it feels like a very emotionless place. It felt like I was in high school when it ended. Just the way he treated it, so whatever about it, ""We should stop talking for now, youre getting too attached and I don't want to hurt you."" When a few days before that he wanted to get matching tattoos with me, but I think there was a different motive behind that.

I told another guy about this and he tried to make it less of what it was because hes just as toxic as the rest of them, he said ""Matching tattoos doesn't mean much, anyone can do that."", ""You're so stuck on him because he got you a stuffed animal and he wanted to get matching tattoos with you? I can treat you better."" Sure, but there IS meaning behind it. There WAS a reason he asked. But now thinking about it this guy used me too because he wanted to sleep with me.

They all do, they are men, but unfortunately I try to make friends with men because im desperate for connection (not love, friendship), but I know that is not possible because it's just not how the world works.

These past few weeks I've been drinking a lot more then normal just to silence myself and feel some kind of enjoyment. My family has a not-so-great history with alcohol, my grandma drowned in a pool when she was drunk.

The verge of my last straw was meeting up with a Korean guy and walking all over my campus just to find a place for him to \*\*\* all over my face. That made me feel so extremely low, and that was a moment where I wondered where all of my self respect went. In my mind I guess I was trying to fit in, most girls do only-fans, so why shouldn't I give men what they want? He wasn't even very cute for a Korean..

My last straw that has led me to do this just happened last night. I made an idiot of myself. I drank the rest of my vodka in my room last night, and in my drunken state, I messaged the friend of the guy who I was seeing months ago (the same guy I mentioned earlier, the guy from Vietnam); for some back story about him, he was curious about me when I was seeing other guy, they would both talk about me, other guy showed him my n\*\*es and he wanted to get in too. Tried to convince me that he cared about me, but he didn't, he DOESN'T. The problem is I really liked him, probably even more then other guy I was with, but I could never tell him that. They both wanted to have a 3-way with me. I wanted to do it just to be admired and feel something, but everything ended so soon. As soon as I stopped talking to other guy because 'I got too attached' and he cut me off, he lost interest immediately too, and I should have just stayed the fuck away. But I dug myself a deeper hole like I always do, and here we are last night, in my drunk mind, sad about the other guy, conflicted with his stupid friend, messaging him a bunch of yip yap. I don't even remember all of what I said because I was so embarrassed I tried to wipe it clean out of my head, but I know I sounded extremely desperate and crazy as fuck and it was just awful. He left me on read the entire time and seemed so uninterested but I just would not stop. 

I just can't live with this, on top of everything else that has happened, this pushed me over the edge, and I don't even want to show my face anymore.

My plan is to go to the top of one of the car garages here at the college, in the middle of the night so no one sees, and leap off. Maybe I ought to drink again before doing this, so at least I go in somewhat of a peaceful state.

People suggest therapy, but I don't want therapy, because it doesn't help. I wanted friends, connections, to not be or feel used. Everyone has a selfish motive. The world is different now. Unfortunately I do care about what other people think of me, I do want people to like me, don't be like me, it puts a really big dent in your potential.

I don't want to be alone, but I don't want to be used.

Being homeless has made actively want to die for months now. But I can’t go to a psych facility for treatment or go to the hospital after because if I did, it would be an endless cycle.

1jq9jwg,2025-04-03 04:44:03,SuicideWatch,Reasons why I wanna kill myself,"I am average, which means I will land on a job that pays minimum or average

I didn't enjoy being around people, bc I have low self esteem and I fried my brain with videogames, and now videogames are boring and I have no one.

Virgin at 23, because I am also a porn addict and excessive beater, so I am no longer attracted to girls and now I have 0 libido.

I replaced people with instant gratification.

I have been working for a very competitive exam to better my future for the last 18 months (my second try for this exam) while being socially isolated, I don't do anything else. Even if I win this exam, it won't pay too good. Also no interest in this job field, doing this only to survive.

Result of this exam and my personality, I stay at home and never go out or talk and meet with new people.

I no longer have the courage to meet new people

I always run out of things when I talk to people, so this weird awkward silence occurs every time, so no friendships and no relationships

I was bullied in every part of my school life because I have been too kind and silent, so I am distant to people

Too late to build friendships and no desire to build one

I have this belief that even if I was in a relationship, I wouldn't be happy and we would fight with each other and end up in a heartbreak, so I don't even try to find love, I don't want to ruin my life or someone else's

I have been suffering from low self esteem my whole life

Getting up, going to work feels like a death sentence, because I know that it won't pay enough and I will live paycheck to paycheck

Low pay, long working hours, and one of the highest inflation in the world (Turkiye).

Nothing exciting is waiting for me in the future. I will eventually get old and die. I won't be having children because I don't like the world.

Azan is played 5 times or more everyday from a very loud speaker, I am an atheist and I hate Islam, so it's bothering and stressing me.

Politicians are ruining everything, corruption is very prevalent

No hope for the future, I also hate my ethnicity; people are rude, loud, boastful, and stupid. One of the reasons I chose to stay alone, there were also nice people but most of them were like these.

My hair is shedding from stress, anxiety and depression. I also won't like the way it will look once I go bald

I wake up at night randomly with heart palpations

I overthink and overanalyze, so I always think about what to say next when having conversations, while other people talk with each other like a breath

I have lived the most boring life; no crazy adventures, no partying, no drinking, no getting laid. Because I spent all my time playing games and worrying about my future.

1jr05fw,2025-04-04 01:32:54,SuicideWatch,Rich & Depressed,"I'm 21, making $40K a month. And I'm depressed. Im the founder of a automotive company. I sell golf cart parts. 

Money doesn't buy happiness. I bought my dream car, a bmw 650i 2014. At first, it was great. I was happy. But after a few days, it just became a car. Something to get me from place to place. I live on my own. I don't have any friends. I've never had a girlfriend in my entire life. I'm very lonely. All I do is work, work, work everyday.

Every girl that I've tried to get something going with has been a gold digger. All the girls that I've spoken with have used me. I personally think I'm not bad-looking, but girls these days only care if the guy is a bad boy, has guns, tattoos, smokes and a sixpack. That's all they care about. They don't care if a guy is loyal to them and can financially support them. All they care about is looks. All the friends that I've hung out with have used me for some type of gain. 

I feel that I've changed so much because of the money. I stopped being humble. I guess people have formed opinions about me. Now, most people think I'm daddy's money, that I've always been given, handouts by my supposedly rich parents, but I've made it all by myself. 

My main motivation in my life has been to prove people wrong. After high school, I didn't go to any university. All the teachers, all of my classmates said that I was going to fail, that I was going to end up just working at McDonald's. Even my parents, threw me out of the house. I was homeless. But now that I've shown my success in my social media, posted my car, posted the sales I've been making, all the cash I've been raking in, now I don't have any other motivation in my life. I just don't know what to do. I have all this money, and I'm  contemplating my life.

1jr02ir,2025-04-04 01:28:48,SuicideWatch,Life is strange,"I'm 25 years old. I'm posting here because the effort it takes to ward off feelings of suicide is becoming nauseating. I was born in a family who should have never had children, and not for reasons typical of abusive families. It's this strange gray area where from the top down any fuctional adult would understand how crushing things would become for me in particular. I feel like a fucking pussy for even putting the words to this in a cohesive passage but I've never been so compelled to make a confession.

Let me first say that I don't have any direct intentions of ending my life, at least not in the present moment. This is purely a cathartic effort toward trying to erase the feelings that sway in and out of my life on a completely regular basis. The passive ideation has been something I've fought against since I was young. That being said, it's a fucking monster of a feeling that grows dramatically each time it rears its ugly head. I'm giving as full of a context as I possibly can because I wholeheartedly don't even give a fuck if anyone reads this in its entirety, I need to let it out.

I was born to a woman and man who hated each other, a tale as old as time itself. My mother had a son who is 18 years my senior with someone who wasn't my father, and two years after me, my parents had another kid, my younger sister. My father fucking hated my older brother, and now than I've grown up I understand it was for good reason. If I gave the full context on that it would take actual days to type out, but the short end of it is he was an undisciplined troublemaker who put himself and my whole family at risk of being in serious harm on several different occasions throughout my entire life. For example I was too young to recall specifics here but there was some kind of incident where he owed some bad people money and they tried to kidnap my infant sister or something insane like that. All that aside, my father had raised me in a manner that suggested I was a ""bad seed"" just like my half-brother. This is where things start becoming strange.

About a year after my sister is born, myself being 3 years old, my mother and father attended some kind of friend's get together and left us with an aunt overnight. At this party, my mother suffered a near fatal head injury that changed the trajectory of all our lives completely. Skipping forward quite a bit, after months spent in the hospital and in physical therapy, my mother came home and was a noticably different woman. The details are hazy because I was a child, but the consensus of this all after growing up and talking with my extended family was that it was an attempted murder spearheaded by my father to either get rid of her completely or have her sent away because she owned half of his contracting business. I know how unbelievable this sounds, but my father was a maniacal man and there were instances in his life prior to me existing where this would make a lot of sense. 

A little more fast forwarding, my mother divorced him, and by the time I was 10 years old or so he lost visitation rights to my sister and I cause he couldn't stop abusing me. It's been about 15 years since I've seen him and I had never realized the detriment of not having a father figure until I grew up and was catapulted into the real world. Not only did I never have a man teaching me how to do man shit, the only person I had to teach me anything was a jaded woman who only had half her brain to work with after her injury. She also had a severe distaste and distrust for men considering all that had gone on with my father, all of the trouble my brother put us through, and the grim reality that she was raped as a teenager and that was how my brother came to exist in the first place. 

With my lifetime of a sob story watered down and out of the way, this left me vastly underprepared to take on adult life. I've been ridiculed and bullied out of just about every serious job I've ever had for my lack of experience and general common sense. I started a career in carpentry and went through so many layoffs in the span of 4 years that I lost my apartment and my car and even the girlfriend I had at the time who ended up having a kid with a stranger while we were arguing. I'm 25 now and I've had to move back with my mom, working a dead end job to dig myself out of the hole I fell into. I've been at it for a year, I've made progress, I've even gotten myself another car, but through all of it I can't keep up with the relentless balancing of ""things are going to be okay"" and ""I want to end it.""

This post is extremely lengthy, but I've never been able to express these feelings honestly due to how frequently my older brother would threaten to take his life to get attention from my family. I live in constant agony internalizing these feelings because I know there's not a single person on earth I can safely share this with. I'm trying so hard to learn a skill that will make me valuable in American life so I can survive on my own because all I've ever wanted was to be able to survive quietly, but things are starting to seem grim and nobody wants to give me the time of day. 

I kind of lost my way typing this out, I guess all I wanted to say was I admit that I am suicidal. I've been fighting the good fight for years but it's manifested into something that's equally as strong as my will to fight it, and it's always getting stronger. I have never been professionally diagnosed with anything but PTSD and some kind of depression from when I was examined after my parents divorce, court orders and whatnot. The point of the post was to get this out of my heart and I do feel some strange sense of relief. If you decided you gave a shit enough to read all this, thanks. I hope we'll all be okay.",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1jr02ir/life_is_strange/

like this is gonna be long but hear me out . so from childhood i was kinda that responsible , helpful friend who knew the solution to all problems and who will listen to ur problems and venting everytime without judging . but for some reason no one does the same for me . like i drop subtle hint that i wanna talk or that i have some issue but no one bothers paying attention . it's like they intentionally ignore it. it feels like utter shit when u ask for help and no one bothers to notice . 

as for my current best friend he did listen at the beginning but now the cycle repeated . once again i got the caretaker role while i suffer from having no one to understand me in silence . like for some reason i am stuck being some ideal who can solve anything but asks for nothing in return but truth i do but no one notices . sometimes i wanna cry but no one will notice . and my good acting skills in hiding it doesn't help . 

i dropped hints but no one notices . it's like screaming into a void . also ig i have abandonment issues . from my childhood , most friends i made ended up leaving me for no reason . like i was always watching from the sidelines when they all played , watching them all talk while i was sitting alone . yea i was good at hiding it but not that good that no one notices . like why is it this way ? why do i go through all of this yet get nothing in return , no one stays with me . is it really that selfish of me to ask for someone to just talk to me as well ? to have one person stay just for me like i did for them for who knows how many times . i do their work , solve their emotional issues yet i am always abandoned . like do i even matter ? at this pt ig even if i disappear no one will even notice except maybe my parents . tbh why not just disappear just out of spite for sending a msg that it's their fault that i disappeared . 

what am i even doing at this pt like i have the imp exam tmrw and rn only these thoughts are coming . every night i feel fucked up . i can't do anything . i have no skill of my own , no passion of my own . why did i spend all my time on them when at the end no one cared . even now i feel that my current best friend will also go since he has better things to do . he is in uni while i am still at home . tbh a loser like me doesn't even deserve anything and ig this is the best thing for me to just disappear from their lives",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1jqqtaq/am_i_even_important_to_anyone/

I've often thought about suicide not as a solution but a way to make things stop completely, the hard part is I don't know what will work for sure. 

I've technically had 4-5 times where I was at 'peace' with suicide. Almost attempting and having the intention and means but backing out last minute to not be harms way. 

If i knew something would work I'd just fucking send it. I don't have access to the right medications and even then health complications of becoming a vegetable are more likely than death. Firearms would work but can't get those either, everything above a fucking air rifle is illegal in my country.

I don't know what to do but want to try make my situation worse so a genuine suicide attempt doesn't seem so unreasonable.

now I'm not new to suicide my own mother is suicidal and has committed suicide 4 times by taking tablets and I have been through it she still is suicidal but me and my dad manage her.

the thing I need help is I don't know what to do should I tell the pharmacy owner this news she asked me not to tell him I vaguely can guess why she did it I think she lacks money and a clear future same with me to be honest. so telling that she tried committing suicide by taking medicine from his store would 100% get her fired and I don't want to add more to her financial suffering by doing that.

The worst thing is that they think they do. They think they care about suicidal people because they care about suicide. It's not the same thing at all. These people don't want you to die but they feel perfectly fine to turn a blind eye to your suffering. The amount of times I've heard people say ""people love you"" makes me want to peel off my own skin. Of course people love me.

1gd9l9c,2024-10-27 12:13:33,mentalhealth,Elections and Politics,"Hello friends!

It's that time of the year again. We have always intended for r/mentalhealth to be a safe, politically neutral space for users, and we wish to keep it that way. We will be removing and locking threads that go out of hand with the political aspects of things.

Political anxiety is more common than you think around election time. If you are having trouble with political anxiety, there are ways to cope with the stress. Here are a few examples:

**Timeout**: Social media, including the news channels, are designed to have a negative tilt to collect views. They want you to keep coming back for more. It is an excellent idea to differentiate between thoughtful and stress-inducing, sensationalized material. It is okay to find out about news after it breaks. By waiting for accurate information and thoughtful analyses, you will be able to provide informative content for yourself. Limiting the use of social media to once or twice a day will be beneficial. If your political anxiety is still too much to handle, it might be time to take an extended break.

**Control**: The majority of what is happening in national and global politics is out of our personal control. Turning our attention to ourselves, our friends, families, and local communities can help us be empowered and productive. Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as hobbies, exercise, and time with friends, can be a healthy distraction. Practicing self-care through wellness techniques and programs can also help keep your anxiety in check. Here are some websites that provide helpful information and tips on self-care:

[MHA: Taking Good Care of Yourself](https://mhanational.org/taking-good-care-yourself)

[NHS: Self-Help Therapies](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/self-help-therapies/)

[El Camino Health: Emotional Self Care](https://www.elcaminohealth.org/community/chinese-health-initiative/specialty-programs/emotional-well-being/emotional-self-care)

**Community**: Connect with individuals who provide a safe space for understanding current events. Sharing what you are thinking and feeling with trusted peers can mitigate the negative effects of stress.

**Engage**: The feeling of helplessness can be stressful and discouraging. Getting involved with a local political party, volunteering with a community group, or participating in activism can help you feel a sense of accomplishment, power, and purpose. These activities also connect communities of like-minded people, which helps to alleviate stress.

**If you are experiencing a crisis or medical emergency, please contact your local emergency services.

About a month ago, I had a dream about my parents being killed, not by me, but by someone else who offered to do it for me. In the dream, I said yes. When I woke up, I asked myself, ""Would I really say yes to that?"" And that's when everything started.

Since then, I can't stop thinking about it. I've even started watching true crime documentaries to see how people hide evidence and where they go after committing a crime. Now, whenever I see my parents, I imagine killing them. Not long ago, I had another dream where I killed my sister, and when her husband walked in, I had to kill him too.

I have a psychologist, but I'm too scared to tell him about this. He sees me as so innocent, and I don’t want to ruin that image. So, I've kept it to myself. At one point, I even thought about calling the police on myself because I'm afraid I might actually hurt my parents, but I didn’t.

Recently, my dad was in the hospital. While my family was really worried about him, I just hoped he wouldn’t make it. I didn’t want to see him again.

My brother has has schizophrenia since the age of 24. He was in medical school before he developed acute psychosis and then came home to live with my older sister and I. I had a difficult life growing up for a middle-class suburban kid. My parents divorced when I was 7. My mom worked as a waitress to keep us afloat before becoming a nurse. I developed an eating disorder in 7th grade around the same time my brother developed schizophrenia and came to live with us. It was a difficult home to live in with him around. Dealing with his psychosis has been like living life on repeat every day. Every day he has fixations, every day there are delusions, weird body language, strange content of conversations, sexual obsessions, etc. He also lacks awareness of his own condition it seems as well. As he grew older with the disease, he eventually developed full blown OCD. Repetitive tics, entering a door and going back through it 20 times in a row, opening and shutting microwave doors the same way, repetitive hand washing, etc.  I was exposed to a lot of disturbed thinking during this time until I left home for college. 

I was doing well academically at school but not well socially. I experienced consistent exclusion from social groups and mild bullying at times throughout my years as a school kid. I developed an irrational fear of women and I had severe social anxiety. By around 10th grade, I developed an addictive habit of gaming and porn use. This has persisted to this day. I never got over my fear of women. I did well academically in high school and okay in college. I could have gone to medical school with my GPA if I applied myself to studying for the MCAT but by the end of college, I was suicidal and depressed and developed a drinking problem. I ended up becoming a nurse (not an insult to nurses, I love my coworkers). Nursing school forced me to open up a lot. I had a great 2 years of life during this time actually. The constant exposure to women who I had to see every day (since most of my classmates were women) forced me to evolve and I actually became more social and less anxious by the end of this time.

I ended up taking up my first job as a nurse in a night shift position. After doing night shift for 5 years, I fell back into isolating habits and also regularly drank again. I tried so many times to quit porn but still use it today. It just feels like a high i can't left go of. It numbs me to the world and gives me something to look forward to every day. Im also 34 and never have had a girlfriend. I had a fling at age 29 with the only girl I'd ever done anything with up to that point in time but since then, I've been alone again.

I'm a 16 Year Old Male and I have major depressive disorder and really bad self loathing issues which cause me to have suicidal thoughts and just beat myself up a lot. I've been told if I have suicidal ideation again openly, I'm being sent to a mental hospital. 

I'm really scared because I've never heard anything good about them and I don't feel comfortorable not having privacy and sleeping in an unknown places for long periods of time. I have no clue what it's like and I'm really really so scared and don't want to go but might have to. Can someone please tel me in detail what it's like honestly?

1jr5a6e,2025-04-04 06:24:34,mentalhealth,I can't let my past go,"16 (M). For the past year I'm almost always thinking about what awful person I was in the past, what bad actions I did and how I treated people and what shit I was yapping, and I'm always mixing myself with shit because of that and feeling that I'm a monster. I tried to calm down myself many times, saying to myself that I was just a stupid teen and I should just let it go, that it's okay, because past is past, but I just can't. Not because I don't want to, but these memories always come back to me. Even if I manage to forget about all this for some time. Every time (like right now) I feel a fucking huge rush of sorrow, disgust of myself and guilt, and I'm always trying to DMing those who I disappointed or hurted to apologize without any result as I get blocked. I just can't deal with who I was and just live a normal life. I really don't know what to do. I really want to live like a normal person but not live with endless feeling of regret and such shit.

And no, I can't go to the therapy bc it's too expensive to me. I don't live in a poor family or smth, but in my country therapies cost very much. Even if I take antidepressants or nerve-calming pills like I did before, these memories don't leave me alone.

I really don't know what to do.

upd: I remember even more moments from my life when I did creepy and stupid shit and I hate myself even more. I don't understand what the fuck was wrong with me and why I was doing that, like if someone asks me why did I do this or that, I can't fucking explain anything. I don't understand what the fuck happens in my mind ans why I'm so weird, and I feel even worse.

The other day I was going to craft a certain item from a game I play called dandy's world (it's my comfort game) and as soon as I started working on it I got the feeling and immediately lost all of my motivation and went back on my phone, this happens way too often and I don't know what to do about it.

2: I feel like I have ""too much empathy"" for one certain person. (That being my mom) Whatever I try to do I always think about ""would my mom like this? Probably, so I have to like it too."" Or ""hm, I don't think my mom would like it, so I don't either"" for example one day I was having a conversation with a friend and they started being sarcastic with me, but that empathy hit me and I thought to myself ""I know my mom doesn't like when I speak sarcastic to her, so I don't think she would want me to be in this conversation."" 

3: I have really bad anger issues, but in a way where I don't express it, it's just there. I get super mad at small things and keep it to myself, usually I'll just stop talking or go in a separate room and cry in anger if I can.

4: I have very bad laziness so my room tends to get very messy, and I try to help it the best I can but it's hard. I don't know why it's as bad as it is but it's effecting me a lot, and it just piles up my stress, anxiety runs in my family, so I also have it really badly and because my room is so messy I tend to think about how I'll fix it in school and stress about it but then I don't do work because I'm always stressing the whole time.

Life has been a series of struggles, and I’m reaching a point where I don’t know how to keep going. I lost my father, and that absence has shaped so much of who I am. Being unemployed and having no one to look up to makes me feel like I’m constantly being judged, like I’ll never be enough.  

I’ve had only one relationship in my life, and it ended in betrayal. She cheated. That hurt, but what’s worse is how it changed me. I’ve lost trust, and I don’t even know if I want to open up to someone again. I tell myself I’ll move on, but I still feel stuck, like a part of me is frozen in that moment.  

I have no friends. No one to talk to, no one to vent to. I deleted all my social media, hoping it would help, but instead, I just feel more isolated. I drown myself in philosophy, trying to find meaning, but sometimes, it only makes the emptiness feel deeper. I overthink everything. My mind never stops.  

I struggle with discipline and consistency.  

Physically, I try to keep a routine—walking, studying, eating right. I even take metformin and a multivitamin. But mentally, I feel exhausted. I started smoking to cope with the pressure, but I’m trying to quit. It’s just another battle in the endless war inside my head.  

I tell myself I believe in destiny, but sometimes I wonder if I’m just making excuses. I want to be respected, remembered. But right now, I feel invisible. Like I could disappear, and nothing would change.  
I have been to therapy also 
I have travelled also 
I have done everything like medicines, counselling etc

1jr3p4d,2025-04-04 04:43:38,mentalhealth,How to deal with depressed mother,"
Six years ago, we had a family member of our stay with us. She seemed great at first, but she faked having cancer and took extreme emotional advantage of my mother who struggled with depression, but at the time had a full-time job and was thriving.

We found out that this sociopathic family member was lying about everything and my mom absolutely went off the rails. 

Since that day, she’s been in the mental hospital three times  in two years, and has not been there in four years. I had to drive her there when she was severely mentally ill multiple times.

She’s on five different medication’s, was an alcoholic, and a weed addict at different points, and she has stopped all of that currently. I became a weed addict for a while, constantly hitting her weed pen whenever she wasn’t around. This lasted for about four years. The last two months I’ve been mostly sober, I do drink beer every night (1-2 cans of German lager). 


I’m so sick of sitting in this pile of shit house. I used to be more full of passion but being in this house is destroying me in ways I can’t describe. I had trouble communicating with women. I get the same feeling with other women that I do when I see my mom. Nothing. I don’t know what to say or to do. 

My dad travels for a living and has gone very frequently for one to two weeks at a time. Since the incident about four years ago, my brother got married and moved out. Both of our dogs and died, just leaving me and her alone at the house. She has “learned helplessness” and constantly ask me to do menial things that she can do herself. She is bipolar and depressed, and we’ve had huge fights in the past but lately things have been more tame.

After five years of exposure than this, I’ve become extraordinarily emotionally numb to her. When I look at my grandma, my dad, my brother and friends, I feel loved, and I can reciprocate the emotions they give me. When I look at my mom, I feel absolutely nothing. Most of the time she is horrifically depressed, and is trying to fish compliment out of me. Constantly trying to get me to show her any type of affection. All of this has made me emotionally numb as a defense mechanism. She can be manic, or extremely depressed. I feel nothing with her regardless of how she is doing. Most of the time she is extremely depressed, and when I come home from school or work and do the bare minimum amount of talking to get pastor and upstairs where I hang out in my admittedly, pretty cool room. 

I’ve developed anger issues towards her. We cannot connect in any other way, except anger. She’s constantly asking me to do menial things, and always tries to offload responsibilities to anyone else but herself. When she watches my brothers kids, she’s always asking me to do things to help her. Put the kids to bed for naps, fill up her water cup, do the dishes (she never does them) clean up the kitchen after her, and much more. 

It’s gotten to a point where everyone in my family expects me to try and take care of her, but I want absolutely no part in this. 

She complains how I never “kiss her good night anymore”. I’m 26. I don’t need to do that. It’s disgusting.

I’m getting unbelievably sick of constantly dealing with this. My brother and his wife moved in and they have had a baby. They’ve been here for the last eight months, but they are planning on moving out soon so we’re gonna be going back to Dog shit again soon

Any advice in what to do?

As pretext: I don't remember much from my past, almost nothing, to be honest, even from my teen years (I'm currently 20). I'm pretty sure I've successfully repressed a number of inaccessible memories. 

To come to the point of my mentioned realization: I've had an objectively *good* childhood, but not particularly a *happy* one. Which was pretty clear in my teen years (I pretty much only remember being highly depressed), but now I'm also sure it has always extended further back, into early childhood. And honestly, I really don’t know how to handle that. I'm so lost on how to feel or process this, even with the help of my therapist. It has left me with... permanent repercussions, so to speak. 

Additionally, I know my family did their best, and there were a lot of factors that weren't easy to control or controllable at all, and they did all they could for me. I'm endlessly grateful. However, I don't know how to explain my new perspective to them, especially my mother, who's both quite emotional when it comes to her children's problems, as well as unable to really understand situations she herself has never lived through (which is the case with this one). 

I've talked to my therapist already and we've been working on possible scenarios should it ever come to a difficult conversation with my mother, but I'd still appreciate any other insights and maybe some other experiences of people who've dealt with similar situations before and had to go through this kind of paradigm shift and how they dealt with that.

1jr1le1,2025-04-04 02:47:05,mentalhealth,I Need a Break,"My birthday is in a week and have no desire to celebrate my life.

I do not know how much more bad sh!t I can take. How do people pick up the pieces and keep going?!

I was laid off from my dream job on 11/1 in Chicago after being unemployed for over a year. I was unemployed for so long that I used up all my unemployment benefits and I had to move in with my angry boyfriend with no self-esteem & his 2 lazy boys (11 & 17). I am reminded daily that he pays the rent and utilities while I pay for the food, internet & phones. His boys do not help around the house, leaves messes that I end up cleaning up, if I mention it to my boyfriend, he gets upset & starts beating himself up that he’s a “bad father”.

With the mess in the US, jobs will be less available and more competition for that 1 job. I have a part-time job that doesn’t pay well where I stuff envelopes, answer the phone & wait on people at the window who need to pay their water bill or police ticket. It’s boring to the nth degree. I am a creative, been in the graphic design/food packaging/printing industry for ages and it’s killing me. I have barely any creative outlet.

On top of my struggle with an angry, hopeless, negative, non-empathic, no-self-esteem boyfriend who talks about taking himself out daily and looking every day for a job, I am now dealing with a medical crisis that leaves me with chronic pain in my chest (extreme heartburn). It got so bad I ended up in the ER last week and I have no desire to eat since eating (and breathing) causes me so much pain. In the ER, I found out about the extreme heartburn, found out about a hernia, and found that I have gallstones. The pain & discomfort are unbearable at times that I cry. My boyfriend gets mad and starts yelling because he doesn’t know what to do, screams at me to tell him what I need, and he’s very negative while I am doubled over in pain. All I want, and I’ve told him, is to be comforted, no words needed. I will be getting an endoscopy (tube camera put down the throat) sometime soon to see how bad the damage is to my esophagus. All I know is that the lower part of my esophagus has thickened due to the abundance of stomach acid. The ER doc told me this week that there is a possibility of cancer. Found out today that I was rejected for another role (a game changer) just like my dream job.

My life has not been easy from the start and I daydream about the day when I am not struggling financially, mentally, & physically, a day where I am wanted & needed, a day where I have someone who actually loves & cares for me as I do so for so many. My birthday is in a week and have no desire to celebrate my life.

Yes, I have a therapist and so does my boyfriend. I do not take medication (yet) to help with my mental distress. Thank gwad I have weed to help talk me off the ledge.

Thank you!",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jr1le1/i_need_a_break/

I'm the only one who had a mostly fked up childhood. When i was 3 i fell down from our terrace to straight concrete face first and the front of my teeth broke out and got my whole set of teeth messed up and it didnt even got fixed till i was 17, and i had the biggest curviest nose in the world so it didn't helped my already not so confident self. THEN i got the 3 weirdest friends in my class in middle school (one was a sociopath, one had serious anger issues and he was a narcissist and the other one was THE weird kid) i had the sociopath friend as my literal best friend until i was 16 because i was so lonely and desparate that lead to years of deppression and a lot of confidence issues and shit like that, but anyways i just wanted to get this out so bad.

1jqvv3z,2025-04-03 22:11:39,mentalhealth,Is it possible for a person to go through CSA and not suffer from serious long term trauma,"I have no idea what triggered this or why it specifically had to happen around this time, but recently, I've come to terms with the fact that I was SA'd at a young age. I know this, and have had a clear memory of the events since the point that they took place, but it just took me about 7 or 8 years to understand that what'd happened to me qualified as sexual assault. It is something that, whenever the topic was brought up, my immediate thought process was one of ""yeah, not something I have ever been through, but...well, there was that one time. i probably shouldnt talk about it cause it sounds really bad, but its not like that"". And while now i can least admit that yes, it was like that, what exactly this entails for me or my mental health has been extremely, extremely difficult to understand.

So, I should tell you I have had my share of problems in the past. I'm diagnosed with autism, depression and anxiety, although at times I don't really agree with that last one. Saying that isn't really much though. Being more specific while staying general, I am someone who for a long time has struggled with low or abysmal self worth, suicidal ideation/attempting, near constant dissociation and detatchment from my sense of self, strong social anxiety (moreso when i was younger) and also paranoia. Ordinary stuff all things considered. The thing is, I have always ascribed these behaviors and symptons of mine to a variety of other origins. Or at least that is what I do when I'm in the capable state of mind to process things. But they made sense to me. Right now they still do, but its just. I dont know. like. What if? i am Almost sure that i dont have ptsd or anything, like really i dont think i do, but it just scares me. the thought of having gone through so much and even any part of that at all being caused by that type of. damage, for lack of a better word, is really scary.  For a bit i rationalized that in actuality i had not even been traumatized at all, but then i mentioned it for the first time to a close friend and i kind of broke down crying. which isnt very normal. 

The part i dont get the least is a feeling of. Not making sense of how i should feel. or how i should have felt throughout all these years. The thing is, the person that did this, i know them. Personally, to this day. Me and my immediate family meet with them once or twice a year. We go to their house, we eat together. And this whole time i think ive just been. Fine with it. And it is not as if what happened to me was something i ever enjoyed at any moment. I know what happened, i know it made me feel vulnerable and unsafe and strange when it did, but i guess beyond that i could never recognize it impacting me in any other way. really as a kid i thought it was just supposed to happen. i could never see that this person did something i didnt want because they desired it, because they got something out of it, it just made sense because they were an adult and therefore knew better than me. So no, never in mind could i register them as a fucked up monster or an abuser, especially as a family member. But then that leaves me at my present day position, where i at the same time know two things, one that they assaulted me, and two that sexual assault is evil, and yet i can still not see them as evil. What the fuck.

1jr0mg3,2025-04-04 01:56:55,mentalhealth,I think Im bipolar. Heres something I've been writing to finally put my thoughts into words,"        This is copied from my notes haha. Sorry if theres any grammatical errors or anything like that. Also, feel free to invalidate how I feel thats kinda what Im looking for lol

        I dont really know what to think anymore. I feel like a completely different person from week to week, day to day and sometimes hour to hour. Theres times where I am suicidal and existential, depressed, disconnected, hopeless and isolated. I get angry at the mere thought of interaction, although I continue to feel these things for weeks on end, I do nothing; Its almost as if I want to feel this way, perhaps because its who I truely am. I something barely feel human. I hate people and interacting with them so much most of the time its so abnormal to me. Alternatively, theres times i feel super excited and jittery about nothing, I cant sit still nor control myself and I connect and interact with people with ease and even joy at times; I completely forget about any of my struggles and hardships and become a completely different person it seems. If I was independent and had nobody to keep me in check, Im worried of what I would do. My ideals and what I believe in commonly changes through these phases, I have violent and anarchic thoughts often and severely struggle with living. I do not know why I dont act on my violent thoughts other than to keep my family happy. How is a thought supposed to just be a thought? I dont even know. On the contrary, when Im 'good' I love socializing, the idea of participating in my community and family, and optimistic for the future of myself and of the world. I cannot and it makes it really hard to maintain relationships with people because one moment I love talking with people and then despise them the next. People are people, why do I have to connect and put myself out there when I dont want to. I dont want to so bad; why? Moreover, along with the shift in emotions and ideals, my hygiene, cleanliness, art style, handwriting, and behaviors change as well. Isolation, uncleanness and less consistent art and sleep is common when Im depressed and disconnected. I miss out on showers, brushing my teeth or hair or just changing clothes. On the other hand, the next week I can become obsessed with my art and its appearance; same goes for my room and clothes. I start buying clothes I probably dont need, my desire to improve myself is too much to ignore at times; I cant tell if thats a good thing or not. Again, these changes severely effect my ability to consistently be social and active in my family and school because how am I supposed to act when I barely know who I am? I dont know. Furthermore, theres times Im all of this at the same time which makes the shifts even more confusing.  I feel like theres something inherently wrong about me. But again, I really, really do not know.

 I hate myself, and I feel useless, like no matter what I do, it won’t make a difference.

My biggest problem is that I have no ambition. I'm incredibly lazy, my health is bad, I have no confidence, and I feel awful about my body. I want to be more energetic and active, but for me, that feels almost impossible.

I used to get really good grades in school, but now I feel stupid. 
Looking back, I realize I didn’t actually learn anything—I just memorized things for a short time, got good marks, and then forgot everything. I feel like I wasted a huge opportunity.

Now I’m 21, getting older every day. I’m in college and will graduate in two years, but I feel like nothing is changing. Every time I try to improve, I just end up back where I started.

I've tried everything—watching motivational videos, reading books, following advice from others—but I always forget and fall back into my old habits. Most of my time is wasted watching p***, dramas, movies, sleeping, eating, or occasionally hanging out. I've never had a disciplined routine for studying or developing skills.

The thing is, I want to learn something. I love the feeling of being good at something—it makes me feel proud and strong—but I can’t even remember the last time I felt that way. The only feeling I know now is shame.

What really gets to me is seeing my peers working hard and moving forward while I’m stuck in the same place I was at 18. It makes me feel depressed, like I’m just wasting my life.

If anyone has been through something similar and found a way out, I would really appreciate your advice. And if you just want to talk, feel free to reach out.

1jr02b8,2025-04-04 01:28:30,mentalhealth,Im unsure am I even depressed anymore.,"This is going to be quite a short post as I don't really want to do long posts yet\~

Ive been going through university lately and Im not going to deny I'm suffering from stress. But as of late I've been realising something, Ive kind of been depressed for most my life and maybe even constantly over the last decade or less. I am still diagnosed with depression as I present most if not all mental symptoms and lately have started to present light physical symptoms.

It feels like my default mood is just sadness most of the time but now that I'm meeting more people when they are depressed they seem to be more impacted by it than me. For example they barely go outside to do anything, cry for hours and the classical symptoms but it looks so heavy for them and affects them to even the next day. Dont get me wrong I experience all of these but at considerably lower severity but more often. For example I do cry yes, multiple times in a row sometimes too for an hour or two but they never really leave an emotion mark, I still go outside just to eat warm food and interact with people as although it sucks and makes me sad I get at least a positive benefit and as of late I've had loss of appetite compelty for a week but I still make an effort to try to eat *even though I don't and it leaves so much trash and rotten food.*

It makes me think maybe I don't have depression anymore? I mean I feel it everyday and wish I had no symptoms inflicted on me but lately It just doesn't affect me as much anymore. For more than 4< years I can confirm I think suicidal thoughts almost every 1-2 days but I tend to wave it away saying that I am not ready yet.

I suffer from debilitating anxiety, depression, ocd, and adhd. I namely struggle with poor working memory, concentration, processing speed, and performance on a daily basis.

I have never been on medication for adhd, although, I am now on medication for depression and anxiety. My memory is starting to improve ever so slightly.

My trainer at work most likely believes I’m special needs as my memory is abysmal, and I ask far too questions. I lack confidence in myself, hesitate far foo often, and generally second guess myself, too.

This whole obsession might stem from ocd, this might just be an “obsessive” or “intrusive thought”. I’m not on medication for OCD. 

I struggle socially, don’t get social cues, usually don’t pick up on sarcasm, and people can’t tell if I’m serious or joking. I have a hard time relating/connecting with others. I believe I’m very socially awkward and others pick up on this. 

When someone asks me a question, I freeze up. I have a hard time answering when I’m put on the spot. Usually at work or in social situations, I go into fight/flight. 

How can I overcome this?

Life with autism often feels like everyone is playing a game and my desire to play the game is zero.

A part of me thinks that everyone hates the game. But people keep playing it because it is the only game in town.

But I think there is another game- art.

I have come to think of art as humans having fun without it coming at the expense of someone else.

CAMHS is currently trying to decide if i need medication as talking & behavioural therapies haven’t been much help but they said they’d like to understand what’s going on with me a bit more first and consider the possibility of there being another diagnosis to be made 

i do agree this this is probably more than just depression but i’m really not sure what, i honestly don’t even know if it IS depression because i don’t have any sort of self deprecating thoughts when it comes to leaving the house, no sort of “everyone hates you” or anything. 
I feel more of a frustration and it’s consistently been my brain and my body battling to get me to leave my damn bedroom, i’ve described it as my brain and my body being separate before and honestly that description feels the most accurate, i WANT to leave,i want to see my friends, i want to go to school and i know i deserve my future, i just can’t seem to get myself to do anything with that desire? 
I do also struggle a lot with getting overwhelmed by simple tasks, as i am writing this im sobbing but i dont feel sad or distressed by acknowledging the situation im in, its just overwhelming for my body and thats so irritating because i know im capable of more than this.
I literally feel like im stuck in the body of a toddler that doesn’t know how to walk.

I haven’t got a clue if there is a diagnosis that this would all fall under, maybe it’s a big symptom of years of self isolation but then again it’s just a continuous cycle if that’s all it is. 

Does anyone know what this could possibly be or what it could be a symptom of?",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jqym5r/what_might_i_be_experiencing/

I am in treatment for depression and currently I'm in between a change in my medication. I had some side effects so my doctors had me swtich meds. It's been a month. 

This change in meds has me feeling distracted, with brain fog, low energy and although I'm functional I am also still sad. My doctors say I have to give time to the new meds. But the thing is, I have work and I am finding myself struggling a lot to catch up with most things I have to do. I get overwhelmed and stuff gets delayed frequently. I can tell my workload isn't too big, in fact I'm not given more than others. But I just can't. Some days I barely get anything done and I worry people at work will soon notice.

1jqxohw,2025-04-03 23:31:56,mentalhealth,"I hate going through life, it is absolute bullshit.","27 M

Ever since my 2nd to last semester in college in 2022, I've been on a downward spiral.  My family sucks and don't get along, I can't get a job in software development  no matter how much I practice, and I lost a childhood friend who I haven't seen in 6 years.

In terms of my friend it is really fucked up.  I think of suicide nearly everyday. Last year was brutal as  I lost my doberman to heart disease and career issues.  I was 27 at the time so fuck it might as well join the 27 club.  I dabbled in partial hanging and slowly was  figuring out.  He last messaged me in late February, but my dog passed on Feb 2nd so I've never seen it.  Around early June I messaged back (we talked through xbox mainly) and brought up the idea of hanging out again.  No response.  I did it again, on Jul 1st.  Keep in mind my bday was july 11th. No response. Fast forward  sometime in August,  for shits and giggles I googled him and found his obituary page.  Turns out he passed away in a car accident May 18th, so I've been talking to a ghost.  In my mind it is so fucked up that I didn't kill myself because I wanted to see him, but he was gone by the time I messaged him, so I was holding out for nothing.

Once I found out I was crashing out, with some self harm (not going into detail)

I hate myself so much for not making time for him as he is the only childhood friend I had that I still talked to.  I was in college and had car trouble, and also was job hunting which is also pointless as i cant land anything.  I'm probably just gonna kms with a gun once my friends wedding is done (highschool friends).",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jqxohw/i_hate_going_through_life_it_is_absolute_bullshit/

I get these feelings now over the smallest things, and it sometimes takes days to get over. I know what causes it, I have been let down, abandoned, or left by so many people throughout my life (sometimes to no fault of their own) that now even just a canceled date sends me into a dark place for a day or two.

This week has been some of the worst feelings I’ve had of this. 

On Monday I was supposed to go out on a date, drove halfway there (he lives an hour away), and he texted me to see if we could reschedule to Wednesday because he was sick. In his defense, he had snapped me earlier in the day to say he wasn’t feeling the greatest.

Tuesday I was supposed to go see a good friend of mine I haven’t been able to hang out with in a few months, but as I got home Monday (from the canceled date) he also called to cancel for Tuesday because of work. 

So Tuesday I was pretty down but at least I had the rescheduled date for Wednesday to look forward to right? Wrong… Wednesday comes and he was going to text me when he got off of work so we could meet. I hear nothing from him, by 7 I gave up hope for that night and just lost it. I didn’t eat, I just went to bed and cried. All I want to do is sleep because I’m sick of crying. I had to pull myself together today and put on a happy face for work. As soon as I got to my car in the parking garage after work I felt an immense numb feeling and sadness. I sat there for almost an hour because I physically couldn’t put my hands on the steering wheel.

As I type this out, I’m laying in bed, wanting to just sleep, but wanting to write this out to try and get it out of my head in a way. How can I make this stop? As much as I am willing to right now, I can’t go to therapy. I make too much to get it for free/reduced cost and I make too little to be able to afford it. I can’t go for a walk or go outside, it’s fucking cold and I am honestly afraid of seeing people having fun together, it’ll only make me angry/lonely. If I stay at home I’m lonely, but if I try and do something fun I’ll be canceled on or rejected, which is worse.

I have been feeling like utter trash because of how on and off I am on and off I am on my schoolwork. All it does is eat at my mind and no matter what I do, I always feel like I’m going to fail. It’s gotten so bad to the point I’m just think gonna wait it out and get my GED, I really just don’t wanna think about it man it just hurts so bad and I just feel so useless about it. It’s like ever since I homeschooled nothing has gotten better, it has only gotten worse and it likely will just get worse over time. I’ve done some work but after I do it, I kind of just hate touching it because it stresses me out severely, and it makes me feel like I may be neurodivergent since it feels like the only way this is happening because this should’ve gotten better, not terribly worse over time. I do also have anxiety and depression and likely other things that just make my education worse. And I can’t just “push through it” because I just can’t do things I hate and despise, it will just cause me to have a breakdown or a panic attack later. I feel I need to apologize to all the people who were involved with my education and just punish myself. I just feel like a really big failure and is just the stupidest and biggest crybaby, since I am crying/breaking down about this whole mess I made. I have struggled with things before and I eventually gotten through them, even when they sucked and took a really big tole on me. But this is something I’m gonna have to live with, because now my education is practically fucked and it will likely hold me back forever. I can just imagine my future now and it just looks so dull and terrible, and I’m just like really scared about it. What if I just tell my “hey this child that you love and thought was going to have an education is actually really dumb and can’t do shit”? What will happen when I have to admit this stuff? Will I be judged for it, will they understand me, will just hate me, will they feel the same, like what will they do? I’m scared. I just feel like a toddler who wants someone’s attention but I can never get it, and I just want it to stop it and get over it already. If I could get a little advice they would be nice.

1jqvucf,2025-04-03 22:10:45,mentalhealth,Meds that are supposed to help my mental health aren’t working.,"TW: Medical, Anxiety/Depression

I started getting help for my mental health around January of this year. After struggling with debilitating depression and anxiety for 6 years now and having no support in college, I made an appointment with my PCP got prescribed Lexapro.
I took 5 mg for the first few days, and it just felt off, but as soon as I started taking10 mg, everything got so much worse. I was skipping lectures, sleeping for most of the day and all night, not eating, and, worse of all, my suicidal thoughts got worse. I thought this was normal, until it got so bad that I was crying myself to sleep and failing all my classes. I called my PCP and was told to immediately stop the medication and take a leave of absence from school.

I then enrolled in a partial hospitalization program to get CBT and have a medical team that can prescribe me the right meds. As soon as I got there, the psychiatrist prescribed me Wellbutrin. I was on it for two weeks, and it felt like it gave me too much energy. I knew it would mellow out, but last week, I started getting motor and vocal tics. After an hour, it started getting worse and at that point, I drove myself to the ED (can’t afford an ambulance) and was immediately admitted. After I got a shot to stop the tics, I was told to immediately stop taking the Wellbutrin and to go home a rest. The next day, I thought everything would be fine, until I started getting the tics again, so I went to the ED again, this time with my parents. I was told that the Wellbutrin was still in my system and it’ll take some time to get it all out. (This was perfect just before my 19th birthday…) It’s been a week now, and I’m still getting tics, though it’s less intense (I’m taking the oral version of the antidote to take care of it now). But now, Wellbutrin is listed on my medical chart as an allergy.

Now, after all this happened, the nurse practitioner thought that the tics could have been caused by anxiety, so she prescribed me Gabapentin yesterday. I took it last night and then started feeling a bit itchy, but I just chalked that up to be dry skin. Around 11 PM last night, my skin started to get itchier and itchier and, you guessed it, I got tics again. I took the medication that the ED doctor prescribed me and tried to sleep off the itchiness, but I just couldn’t. Everything was SOOOO itchy. At this point, I just wanted to peel my skin off, but I obviously can’t do that, so what do I do? I take a shower in the middle of the night…
Even after I take the shower, I’m still itchy and at this point, am bawling my eyes out because 1. I’m so so tired from taking both the Gabapentin AND the medication for my tics and, 2. I was feeling super hopeless that there was a way for me to be medicated without going to the ED or making my mental health worse. 

So, Gabapentin is now listed as another one of my allergies. Today, I’m spending time at home, still itchy, just trying to figure out why all of this is happening to me and if it’s actually worth all the trouble to fix my mental health problems.

1jqujj5,2025-04-03 21:17:25,mentalhealth,What am I doing wrong? Am I really the problem?,"I was kicked out of a discord recently for multiple things. I was in this channel for 8 months no issues before, only started having issues the last 2 weeks.

Summary: (all these I was NEVER warned about before I was removed, except for #2)

1.) venting too much in vent tab about commission work stress for 2 weeks
2.) venting outside of tab multiple times by accident (others have done this multiple times and was warned too)
3.) accidentally misgendered multiple people multiple times
4.) left someone’s username in the picture of the commission, which I didn’t know could lead to doxxing since people outside the discord were upset with the colors

According to the mods, I had multiple complaints about me for these things, and they never once told me these things, or tried to get me to change my behavior, they instead removed me and decided to tell me afterwards. I didn’t use the venting channel 24/7, it was only more recently due to fursuit commission work drama stress. 

Apparently, I made people feel like they couldn’t use the vent channel anymore because I kept talking about stress involving my fursuit commission work for only a couple weeks, that I was needing to finish since I’m a new fursuit maker and have been working on stuff for months, and I didn’t want that all to go to waste if the person themselves isn’t problematic, and I was getting close to finishing the suit that would later cause me drama on TikTok. They looked too similar to a zoo’s character due to the colors, which both the commissioner and I didn’t know until it was pointed out. 

I had to redo parts of the suit itself, so of course I was upset for having to work extra hours to redo stuff when I was already not getting paid for anything other than cost of materials. People told me I should just cancel the commission or only worry about myself, but I told them no because I run the risk of making something for someone bad in the community and not know it until it was too late anyway, and said some people will not like me either direction I go, or no matter what I do online, everyone gets haters at some point. Maybe that’s what made people not like me?

Am I in the wrong here, or was I discriminated against because they just didn’t like I was finishing that commission and had a “love me, hate me” attitude about it? Maybe they thought I was arguing when I wasn’t, which is why I said I wasn’t arguing, but apparently the way I text makes it seem I am?? This whole situation has just traumatized me, and I don’t think I want to talk to furries or people anymore due to the suit drama other than in a professional way, cause if this is how I’ll be treated for a design, which isn’t even from a bad person, I don’t want to be apart of it anymore. Of course I had many tell me the colors of the suit weren’t even a problem, but I deleted all my post talking about it since it had the person’s username in it, and the problem was fixed and people were happy afterwards.

1jqu0fd,2025-04-03 20:56:46,mentalhealth,How does medication work?,"I’ve struggled with OCD and anxiety for many years and have been taking Sertraline for 2 months now. Since I’m under 18, my GP prescribed a low dose to start with, I take half a tablet, though I’m not sure of the exact amount.

I know these medications take time to work, and symptoms can sometimes get worse before improving. I’ve read about side effects like nausea, but so far, I’ve mostly just felt dizziness and tiredness, though that could just be me in general.

I’m not sure if it’s helping yet. I still worry, but maybe a little less? I think I feel calmer, but it’s hard to tell. However, I’ve noticed that as the day goes on, I start feeling more and more depressed. I usually take it around 6:30 AM, and while I feel fine during the day, by evening, I feel really low. This is unusual for me, I normally don’t struggle with depression and am generally happy at home.

Is it normal to feel this way, especially on such a low dose? Can someone explain how this medication works?",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jqu0fd/how_does_medication_work/

As the title says, i keep getting stun-locked by memories of awkward moments, some recent, some years ago and its starting to annoy me.

I listen to alot of music and podcasts which helps keep my mind quiet but sometimes my mind wanders and steps on a mental wound causing me to wince and shake the thought out of my head (this is what ive been doing to stop the thoughts when i land on them)

Its strange because i usually have a terrible memory but i seem to excel in remembering the painful moments id rather forget.

I (16M) never though I would even get this far, so as you can imagine, I'm pretty scared to mess this up.  For some context, I have been diagnosed with a multitude of mental health issues (depression, GAD, (HF) autism, etc.). 

Anyways, I've found that whenever I'm around my girlfriend I instantly relax. So much so that I actually get quite tired. For one, I'm wondering of I've managed to condition myself into being tired around her as we call every night and fall asleep on call. This being said, when she's not around, I get quite stressed and anxious. It not like I don't trust her. Of course I do and would never question her. But whenever she leaves I find my self quite anxious and in return prone to anxiety attacks. I'd say I'm quite an emotionally intelligent person and understand my feeling quite well. I feel like I definitely should not be feeling like this. I feel I've grown super attached much too quick. 

I'm very scared to mess up this relationship. Even before I met her, the thought of a breakup with anyone provoked a lot of anxiety and anxiety attacks. I don't know what to do. I can't imagine I should be feeling like this but maybe I should? I really don't know. Any advice/ideas would be much appreciated.

I am so happy for my friend… but all I can think about is that every single person in that room still looks like they did or better.

I’m unsure if this is the correct place. I have been having some severe issues since moving back in with my parents house. I won’t describe them but professionals have said I should move out as soon as possible. 

I get so exhausted from the issues at home that I turn up to work (WFH - 2 days in office) and really focus on my work but no one else. My team like talking to each other, but I find it difficult to even come up with anything to say so I stay quiet. I have had a few members of the team mention this indirectly, which makes me feel terrible. It doesn’t feel like anxiety, it’s just that my mouth will not physically open to say anything. 

Things I have tried:
- new hobbies
- therapy every two weeks
- making new friends
- trying to move out (I’m not on a permanent contract so estate agents won’t accept me with the current financial and housing climate)

I want to ask if anyone has any other advice I may not have thought of? I have successfully found new hobbies and friends but they don’t take me out of this headspace and I can’t spend time on either of them for that long.

I’m in my early twenties. 
My brain feels like it’s in this “stupor” a lot of the time, especially when dealing with new or complex new information like at work.
It’s Like this cloud of doubt and confusion, slowness in my brain where I struggle to really comprehend and make sense of concepts, connect other information to it, kinda bad memory etc… feeling easily mentally overwhelmed by information and problems to solve.
I also forget words and struggle with speech sometimes too. Stumbling on my words, not forming proper sentences - like my brain is not providing me with the right words that I’m looking for to express my thoughts

Which is also exacerbated by social anxiety

Literally makes me feel like I have learning disability sometimes lol. It’s very frustrating and depressing

I believe this is due to a combination of factors:

- drug abuse in teenage years (14-17 I smoked weed fairly regularly, for about a year I abused mdma - probs like a total of 15 times, as well as experimented with other drugs)
- had some negative social experiences in these years too
- now live quite unhealthy lifestyle (unhealthy eating, corn addiction, social media addiction, no exercise, not much social interaction)
- could also be an element of kinda low IQ and neurodivergence, although I was in the average zone in school generally, never the smartest but not the dumbest either. 


If my brain is just permanently fried, then I can learn to accept that and hit the oil rig.🤣🤣
But if there’s a possibility of restoring some of my brain power I want to try everything I can. 


Do you have any similar experiences of damaging your brain through drugs/trauma/unhealthy lifestyle, and managed to improve it and restore cognitive functioning somewhat? Or know anyone with these experiences?

Graduated recently, and now I just feel like I’m floating. Nothing to do. My only real friends found jobs and are working full-time, so they barely have time to hang out.

Engineering majors barely have time for anything outside of surviving.

Now I’m just at home, unemployed since graduation, bored out of my mind, lonely as hell. I go to the gym — honestly the only thing keeping me somewhat grounded. Otherwise, I don’t know where I’d be mentally. I’ve fallen back into my porn addiction and I can feel it messing with my brain again.

I’m trying to quit, slowly. But it’s so hard when there’s nothing else going on in life. No joy, no excitement, no people to share anything with.

1jqr9kp,2025-04-03 19:10:57,mentalhealth,NYer looking for psychiatrist,"Hey, thanks to anyone who reads and can offer any advice to me about this.  So, I most recently have been receiving care from Housing Works (I have Medicaid and Medicare) because I was a heroin addict and they offered addiction services.  The whole time I was using, even once it turned into a fent addiction, my doctor was treating me fairly and prescribing my medications.  Then I decided it was time for me to quit using drugs and I did a not so great crosstaper w suboxone, I really was against the idea of getting and staying on maintenance drugs such as methadone and suboxone because I've always relapsed when using them and tbh I know so many ppl who are now addicted to suboxone who weren't even addicts to begin with that I just didn't want to be dependent on anything at all that had to do with opiates and I thought that would be a good thing.  

Problem is, it's becoming blatantly clear that my doctor is not only disappointed in the fact that I'm not currently using any of those drugs and repeatedly has made it clear that unless I agree to being on a maintenance drug she will not prescribe me anything I need for mental health.  I'm about 70 days clean and have been taken off all meds but one and I'm pretty sure the only reason that wasn't cut was because I can't just be taken off, you need to taper, which I'm now in fear is her next step, she's angry that I refuse to be addicted to a replacement. I'll then be on zero medication, and I very clearly need treatment and have various diagnoses that require medication.  I'm in need of a psychiatrist who is willing to work with someone who is past an addiction and not interested in maintenance drugs.  It's been really scary how I've been treated recently, and I feel like there is an alterior motive they have that I'm unaware of.  I've never seen doctors try so hard to put a clean addict on drugs and literally start stopping all my medication because I refuse to be addicted to suboxone.  I've even been forced to take them while on video.  I need actual mental health care, and my biggest problem right now is w anxiety because she prescribed me Diazepam for the end of my withdrawals, and I actually responded great to it.  It didn't knock me out like xanex does and I was being super active and I was comfortable with my dose and happy overall but the second I jumped off suboxone she said she could no longer prescribe me it because it wasn't ""safe"".  After doing some research it seems that ppl in nyc who have anxiety are having trouble being treated, as many doctors have become very anti-benzo which I can understand but I don't want a doctor who is just outright against any treatment option.  I feel like every patient and case is different and should benefit from whatever has shown benefit.  That then led to many ppl moving from benzos to ketamine for anxiety/ptsd.

I was thinking today, how were these days like year ago in the summer where my mental health was really bad, I felt like I was being watched, judged and pointed as a monster because of my condition named Pectus Excavatum

In the summer like I said, I hated being without t-shirt like EVEN in front of the house, I started to think about to even going to the public pool when I was there with my family, I did not wanted to go to the pool, as soon as I went there the feeling of hundreds and hundreds of judgements were going through my mind like what was that man over there thinking about me, also I cut myself those days and I felt like my mind is burning.

So today I was thinking about how my mental health was better than year ago and felt like I wanted to go back, wanted the feeling of judgement back, maybe it will be the same this summer as it was before i don't know but felt better in winter times. I sometimes think about ending it even these days, geting hit by bus. i was once looking over bridge and imagined myself hanging over highway. This thoughts did not left me like I am still the weak boy.

Does anyone have the feeling to go back and be the same person that strugles and be the person that hated yourself.

So a year ago I went a wedding. At the event, I saw a really beautiful girl. She was exactly my type. She was from the groom's side and I was from the bride's side. I really wanted to talk to her but I figured that it would come off as kinda creepy. Plus, I noticed that she wasn't smiling that much so she was either tired or not liking the event too much. When we were all dancing, I noticed that she was just standing in the corner alone. I thought about approaching her and starting a conversation and maybe try to convince her to join us. But I figured she wouldn't like some random guy approaching her. The next day my sister and I were talking and I accidentally let it slip that I thought a girl was cute. She asked about her cause her best friend was the bride so she could set me up. I declined again. I never forgot about her though. 

Fast forward to today and this topic is brought up again. My sister asked for her picture again. I was kinda going through it so I went through the wedding photos and found her. She looked at it for a second and told me ""I know her. She is X's sister. She committed suicide recently. She tried a few times before but they couldn't save her this time."" Apparently, she was depressed and had trouble socializing. Remember when I said her expression was familiar. It's cause I had that same expression when I was younger. I desperately hoped for anyone to reach out while standing alone in a corner. I feel like I saw my younger self and ignored him. It felt like a younger me committed suicide. On one hand, I'm kinda glad that I didn't ask her out. What she needed was professional help and not a relationship. I'm pretty sure I couldn't give her the help she needed and I would've suffered due to my own failings. But on the other hand I feel so guilty. What if things were different? What if I approached her then?

I don't know how to process this and I don't know what to think anymore but I can feel the guilt slowly rising. Help",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jqqo9i/a_girl_i_wanted_to_ask_out_committed_suicide_and/

1jr5hkt,2025-04-04 06:38:34,addiction,I’m addicted to being numb,"When I say high, I’m meaning weed, drunk is just alchohol in general 

I’ve dealt with quite a lot in my life, I’m 19 and said I’d never get into drugs bc I’ve had 2 dads literally die either directly from drug use or their health was worsened by it, but now i smoke 2-3 times a day and now just drink a lot

Frankly, it’s not the feeling of being high or drunk , it’s being numb. It’s not overthinking for once in my god damn life, it’s depressing but I literally cannot cry unless I’m fucked up or I’m crying bc someone else feels bad

I’m at the level where I’ve accidentally caused people to cry by just talking about my past and the surface level shit, and I know that’s no excuse but still

I know it’s a problem so I’ve gone the easiest solution by cutting weed out entirely, but now I’m just drinking to numb myself and am about to cut that entirely too, I’ll go days without either when I’m feeling better sometimes so i know it’s not a chemical thing 

I know it’s a problem and I’m at least confident that no matter how low I get I won’t try anything worse bc I’ve been lower than Low and still never even considered it but I’m still afraid of all the stuff it’s doing to me now

I frankly don’t know what the point of saying all this was but I need to just like talk idk

I want to feel something for once, I’ve forgotten the feeling in the least emo way possible and I hate it

I've never used substances, but I think it's because I've never had to. I can knock myself out and numb myself without needing to use anything. My early environment forced me to be able to disassociate at a very early age, by 3, 4 yrs old. Also, I don't know if my brain learned how to do this to save me from my environment or if it was just something I was born with, but I can fall asleep on command. If I lay down, I'm asleep in seconds. 

Whenever I've told people this, even therapists, they never pick up on my pain nor my desperation. They hear me say how I can sleep whenever and immediately they do a little joke about how they wish they could do that and they won't take this as a problem. I look like shit. Sometimes I sleep all day after sleeping all night to where my heart even feels like it doesn't work right. It's not normal, healthy, restful sleep. I can make myself crash out and when I wake up 8 hrs later, my body finally gets to let out a breath of relief because in sleep, my body is in such a tight ball, all my muscles squeezed all through the night, that for me, waking up is a relief. So as you can see, I don't wake up rested. I feel like a zombie. 

I've been healing from past stuff for the past few years, and I've come a long ways, but Im only gonna be able to heal so-far because I keep using sleep to mood-alter. If emotions are challenging during the day, which they are pretty much everyday for me, I lay down. I've only had maybe 3 days all of last year where I didn't medicate through sleep to make it through the day. 

I have bags on bags on bags under my eyes and my physical health isn't going to last much longer if I keep this up. 

I've resonated with addicts my entire life. Ive spent countless hours watching all kinds of media about addiction, but didn't quite understand why I was drawn to watch. 

I'm isolated and I barely leave my place. Finding myself going out less and less. 

I need to take my own problems seriously. I haven't really been since no one else has and since my addictions arent the norm and aren't even talked about. But I need help and these issues need to be addressed.

i almost think of it like drinking once in a while because i could never resort back to using everyday it’s just such a terrible unhappy life but i can’t promise her that i can be sober for the rest of my life because i can’t even promise myself that.

i love this girl she’s such a good person and we could create an amazing life together the only real problem is the addiction and me using. i don’t want to hurt this person and probably should not of gotten into a relationship but here i am. i just don’t know where to go with it. i wish it wasn’t so hard on her if i did use once every couple months or so as fucked up as that sounds. i don’t know what to do because im working on recovering and loving myself and this life and i think im doing okay and making progress but then i look at how anxious she is about me and i feel like maybe im not doing good. i dont know what to think lol please give any advice or if you have any questions leave them below :)",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1jqxkjb/i_need_helpadvice/

1jqh90a,2025-04-03 12:34:49,addiction,3 months sober from cannabis. Thoughts and reasons why I became addicted in the first place,"A few days ago I hit 3 months of sobriety. This month is probably the best because the cravings are vague and very manageble and I found a lot of other things to do: studies, work and hobbies. But there're still loads of work to do: I'm at the point now where I became addicted in the first place. When you get sober for a long period of time you start to see things more clearly. For me weed wasn't a cause but rather a very logical outcome: I was very self-concious, depressed and anxious all the time and used to turn to other things to shut off my mind: online games, porn and, eventually, weed (which worked the best in combination with other stuff). All those things would only worsen the problem that had to be paid attention to and to be fixed. And now, since I minimized all these things, there's fertile soil to actually become stronger. I was amazed how meditation helped with my case: all the emotions I have, I wouldn't feel them or pay attention to them, but they were still there and ruled my life. Now I've been training myself to actually feel, classify and localize a particular emotion and then proccess it rather than dull it, which had a huge impact on the social aspect on my life and the overall wellbeing. I don't think it's possible for me to just quit weed or any other addiction and have the same life I used to have, there gotta be a complete change (gradual, but change). It's also funny to observe your brain doing tricks to persuade you to downgrade your life back where it was, a life that it's got so used to. A thought about change is intimidating to it. Your brain will say: ""See, it's been 3 months, you wasn't addicted afterall as you managed to stay off dope for that long"" or ""Well, now you've changed and there's absolutely no way that you'll return to the point of getting high every single day, you're smarter than that, so you'll smoke moderately"". Once you start paying attention to the direction of your thoughts rather than their content, it gets much easier every single day.

I get very less money to spend throughout the month. I have to manage all my expenses in around 1-2k. My mental health was good until I stumbled upon some so called fantasy apps (gambling hai mc). First it started with 1₹ investment, I don't know what exactly was I thinking prolly thinking that 1₹ is not a big deal and I will try it for fun and nothing else. But you know what, life doesn't always goes as planned. I won like 49₹ in my first match only and that dopamine hit was like crazy. 

Then I joined the same ipl contest for further matches for 49₹. Then after 2-3 matches I lost one. This is where I should've stopped but I didn't. I invested more 49₹ thinking it is a small amount and 49₹ won't do much and there we go, The cycle goes on. I kept losing one match in between every 2-3 matches and lost 49₹,39₹,25₹,24₹ which is around 125₹. And now I'm regretting all this investment and I don't know how far im going with this. Im feeling miserable, shamed and what not.

I was thinking I know everything and can win something but yk what this thing just leaves you empty and depressed. You cant sleep at night thinking bout this shit. 
And our idols promote this shit shamelessly. Even the elderly's do this shit and give it a tag of fun but don't know what influence it leaves on the younger ones. All my friends, nearly 60-70% of the people are engaged in this shit.

1jqds29,2025-04-03 09:17:30,addiction,Relapsed for 10 days.,"At first, it felt easy. Effortless. No guilt, no shame—just comfort. Like nothing mattered.
“It’s fine, I’ll start a new streak soon.”
“One more video won’t ruin the next recovery phase.”
Lies we tell ourselves when the dopamine is high and the mind is numb.

But now, the numbing has worn off.

And here I am—lying in bed with a foggy brain and a heavy heart.
The dopamine is drained. My mind hurts.
I feel like a hollow shell of myself. No energy, no willpower, no emotion—just dread.
The weight of regret settles in. You try to distract yourself, try to move on, but nothing works. Nothing feels good anymore.

And worst of all?
That voice creeps in:
“Was it worth it?”
You thought you were down before the relapse?
Compare it to this—this darkness, this pit you’re in now.

This post is a note to my future self. A reminder of what the last three days have felt like.
The emotional chaos, the depression, the guilt, the sleepless nights.
Because when the next urge comes, it’ll try to sell me another lie—that it’s worth a few seconds of pleasure.

It’s not.

This is my proof. My evidence. My blueprint to remember the price I pay every time.

Stay strong. One day at a time.

1jq7ewp,2025-04-03 02:50:13,addiction,How to beat fent/ how to help someone on fent get clean and stay clean ?,"25(f) with a 27 (m) I’ve been with my bf now for almost a year. I know it’s not that long but we’ve been together like everyday. In beginning of relationship I’ve noticed signs overly tired, not as in the mood sexually, nodding, dozing and taking awhile in car. Constant fatigue and napped a lot or slept late. He is a smoker weed and cigs so I thought maybe he was rolling up etc just chilling. He would usually come to me a few hours after coming home from work. But I’d have to call him a lot because he’d fall asleep a lot when he got home. On multiple occasions I’ve found foil, burnt foil specifically and he would leave marks on my door I’d see it on his head and hands from touching his face he would be covered in black debris. He always admitted to no problem. I’ve found him nodded out in car with foil straws and substances. Multiple occasions Id get in the car when he’s nodded out and has no idea I’m there and question him and tell him to tell me the truth I won’t judge. I know he needs help but I can’t help him if he doesn’t own up to him having a problem. This has happened maybe 3/4 times I’ve caught him always blames thca. I was dumb and did my research and people do smoke thca on foil so I gave him the benefit of the doubt but researching symptoms lead me to believe it was an opioid. He’s struggled in the past with Xanax and perks and got clean. But he’s beaten every at home drug test. Because of the signs I saw in him I suspected fent. But wasn’t sure. He’s pretty functioning besides the extreme fatigue and nodd. He’s a great partner super nice sweet thoughtful. Recently we fought again because I found him nodded in car. Then I said I can’t be with you because you lie and lie and lie and I don’t deserve that I know I deserve more. But I can’t help but feel like I’m abandoning him because I feel he needs help. A few days go by I was supposed to see him and then I called and he answered crying saying he needs help. His mom caught him with foil and straw and substance. But he claims he flushed it. We had kinda an intervention with some family and me and we agreeded he needed to detox and he needed to tell us the truth. He blamed it on perks and he flushed everything bag and all. Something told me check the pants when I went in his room. And I found bundles or shit tied up in rubbber bands I went to his mom and confronted her and he came in all upset trying to snatch shit from me I blocked the door and took it back she dumped it on the bed and said what is this. I said it’s not perks I’m not dumb and he admitted it to be fent. Knowing that it’s fent, I’m terrified I don’t want him to die on me. I’m scared my anxiety depression and mind is racing all the time I feel like a detective on here trying to find out what shit could be and how he’ll withdrawal. He went cold turkey but he said he’s been weening himself and he didn’t want to but agreed. He didn’t even give it 24 hours and I found him in the bathroom with foil and straw I broke down it breaks my soul. I’m so scared for him I don’t want him to die. All he wants is to ween of fent himself but how will I know how much he takes. I can’t monitor that. I do believe he wants to stop I don’t think he wants to be dependent I do believe that. I think it has him in a chokehold because of the withdrawal symptoms and he’s scared to go through them. He went through them for like 3/4 hours and he said he wanted to die he can’t take it , he can’t do it, and he needs to ween himself off. I also told him it’s a mental thing he needs to talk himself into it that he could do it and he is strong and he’s not gonna die and he will come out stronger.  I know in my heart he doesn’t wanna be this way. I do believe people could change. He has an option to withdrawal and take tramadol (controlled tho ) to try and help symptoms but idk how effective that would be. What am I supposed to do? Stay and support him and hope there’s light at the end of the tunnel? Do people ween off of fent alone and have the will power to not do more ? Is he a compulsive liar and will I ever trust him? He’s broken to many promises and I’ve caught him with stuff to many times. I feel addicted to trying to understand his addiction. I do have codependent tendencies so I feel empathy and sympathy for him and don’t wanna abandon him but I feel like I’m abandoning me. What do I do ? How could I help? Will things get better ?

1jqem8u,2025-04-03 10:11:57,addiction,"10 days: no alco, coke, cigarettes - the super fast end of addiction? (With a LOONG preparation for it)","Dear all,

I am super glad to have this feeling of maybe being free for good? On the 10th day, after semi-developed addiction (but still an addiction), I have caught myself for the past 3-4 days, that I feel actually \*better\* than on coke or on alcohol: in the intensity and the duration of my state. I.e., this renders coke, alcohol, cigs useless, then? 

I am super glad, and I think the universe sort of aligns with this feeling by having only the sunny days for these same days.

I mean, for me the hardest was the 3-4-5 days, I think, when I felt this loss of control over the addiction: i.e., I want to get drunk now, and I start having this pleasant anticipation of a pleasure, so I was almost to go for it. However, I had to lie, to reflect, to cry out, to pray, that this was rather tragic, actually: am I not the one in control? Am I to be forever under this demon and fight these urges forever? I cried and cried. So, I even woke up during the night, feeling ""fuck, I need a rest from this urging me all the time during the day"", like some sort of entity tried to manipulate me into promising to give it a rest. THen during the day, I had anger about work's colleauges (who were ""stupid fuckers"") and sadness (""because my wife left, not only cuz of addiction, but of this also, but it's difficult and I am not SO much concerned, but still kind of am, especially when we were doing alco, drugs together""). So, then I just had this ""fuck, I want it"".

And, maybe that's the core part: I was doing psychotherapy with a very good coach/psychologist/spiritual guide, who had me meditate on the feeling of an urge (a day before the above urge). So, I found out that the urge simply disappeared once I have accepted myself? Like, the desire for drunkenness (from anything, really) is just a response to avoiding the pain of not accepting myself. No matter the reason why, but it was quite bizzarre.

And then, after a few days, of walking, without drinking, I was also getting emotional that I was basically anesthizing myself (funnily enough, coke also is like dental anaesthetic, so I found this sort of symbolic), and thus avoiding life, and not actually living and experiencing it? The joy that is much greater? I even got into this surreal, psychedelic like state (w/o drugs) that ok, I actually experienced a \*different\* perception, that is sober, but still different and interesting, as it's not the same old ""get drunk"".

And as a result, I was just feeling like these goose bumps for 1-2 hours, which I have at max for 5 mins on coke. Also, by focusing my thoughts in the direction of ""I resolved this shit, so what much else can I resolve?"", I intensified this sort of euphoric state of achievement.

Moreover, without alcohol and drugs, I had my orgasms much stronger, like it's a sort of energy flowing through me, and also without the porn.

And ok, fair enough, I am still eating chips, but - it's maybe only temporary crutch, and still much better. I ate them anyway with the drugs.

So, in the end, the main question: ""what would them drugs gimme anyway?"" is to be answered by ""a temporary, though guaranteed switch in the state that is worse than I could have organized myself with the consequent depression and further cravings in the future, resulting in the loss of control"". I think, this is a checkmate idea.

And ok, I may sound arrogant here, and I also recognize that saying ""I solved this"" and then bam, a relapse or something, but even then I had preparations that even if the case, even then, I would \*know\* that it's 10 days I didn't do this. And so, like a strategist, I am setting up all these ideas, all these self-reinforcements in all the ways that could potentially have me dragged into the useless shit, based primarily only on this minor subconscious demon that maybe doesn't even want to be inside me.

For instance, I resolved the urges like that: since, I have all these stupid ideas, like ""why don't I grab the wheel of a taxi driver and drive us into the pithole to die or cripple ourselves?"", of which at first I was sort of ashamed, like am I crazy? But then I understood that some have these, and I don't act on it, and so why bother? Then the urges are of the same class: they are not something special, but rather also just stupid ideas that have no basis, on which I can decide not to act. Easy. 

Also, since I finally had the subjective reinforcing experience of feeling good without drugs (well, ok, I still drank coffee, but it's not comparable): then the urges are also easily resolved by referring to the experience of sitting in the sauna on the countdown, on running 10km marathon, on going through the gym sets, or sitting for 6h on a tattoo session, about 10 sessions within 2 weeks and accepting the pain, sort of. All these also cover the flanks, sort to say, like the military units.

And so, in the end, I just wanted to share the experience, and I am still getting used to the good, as my coach told me, when I shared the experiences of feeling unusually well without shit, and being interested and engaged.

In the end, all the hormones: dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, noradrenalin, adrenalin, etc. - they are all within me. So, this means that I am the one who can trigger these states, and it's sort of stupid to lose the ability to an external substance. This is the core of not wanting an addiction -> it's like selling a soul to the devil for him to give you your desire, when in fact, your soul IS the thing that can grant you that desire and infinite number of other desires. Selling a debit card with infinite money for a million dollars. Same logic everywhere.

Though, of course, it took me WAY long story of going through psychotherapists (maybe, 10 years, in fact) and during this time the addiction raised or subsided. Like dropping cigs, amphetamines, weed, but keeping alco. And fair enough, judging on what I uncovered in psychotherapy: my mother when dying of cancer blamed me for her death when being in this sort of semi-aware state; a divorce, and everything else, which I have just accepted as a part of my history. Again, I decided to convert the suffering into profits: for instance, now, I can rely on the experience of dropping the addiction process in my future projects. By doing it alone, without the use of psychiatry or rehabs, I am not going to win even a billion of dollars, figuratively speaking, I am going to win the whole world of experience for myself. Namely, working AND feeling good about it. Fucking AND having intense orgasms about it. Speaking to people AND not feeling anxious and being super aware of my and their's psychology and maybe using it to help them, create efficient business processes, make money, travel the world, eat great food. Working and studying AND feeling very aware.

Speaking of the latter, as I dropped it all, I started feeling higher awareness. Like, I am smart myself. But if it's all been covered by the brain fog of drunkenness, then hell am I going to be much more quick. Like, I was just smiling for being very aware of the French exercise that I was learning. This state of feeling good makes me feel even better all by itself: like, I just smile at that I smile at the world without any chemical intervention.

So, it's like this for now. Maybe, this could help someone. After all, addiction is a sort of life's challenge. Tackling addiction is a sort of a game: how can you outplay and outmaneuver a subpersonality of yours before it will chase you to a grave. Maybe, addiction can be appreciated for all the challenges that it teaches you to overcome. Doesn't mean that you need to partake in it, but once you have it, then maybe learn from it. I have a nice principle from childhood stories that you should strive to convert foes to friends, as it would mean that the next foes you face would be even more likely to convert to friends, since you have your older foes at your side already, and so it's a snowball rolling.",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1jqem8u/10_days_no_alco_coke_cigarettes_the_super_fast/

My first drug was ecstasy. I took it with my ex-boyfriend. It felt magical – like someone finally hugged my soul.

After our breakup, I lived alone in a small apartment. I felt free. But also lonely.

That’s when I started going to parties with a friend, and taking ecstasy more often.
I met a guy there who was already deep in drugs – MDMA and cocaine.

When I got back together with my ex, we started using MDMA together at home.

In 2022, I started going to clubs every week. I didn’t even drink alcohol anymore – just pills. I loved how it made me feel: light, connected, free.

But soon, the parties weren’t enough.
I started snorting MDMA at home. Alone.
I was chasing the euphoria.
I just wanted to feel anything but real life.

That’s where it really began.

This is part one of my story.
I’ll keep posting each stage, because maybe someone out there needs to hear it.

I constantly hear my neighbours talking about taking me to court for a restitution for property damage to furniture and the air conditioning system and it’s going to cost upwards of 200,000 and that I will likely get out on mental health grounds because of my bipolar.

They are apparently testing the waste water because our pipes are connected so whenever I urinate or number two they test it and see if the readings gone up or down. 

Apparently I caused someone to have a failed pregnancy because the chemicals somehow went through the air conditioning system which is supposedly connected centrally for everyone in the apartment system and I also broke the aircon somehow as well which will be in the court case.

They are testing samples on my rubbish like drink bottles etc and are following and tracking me everywhere and commenting about my life.

The scary part is they’re saying things I never thought of before or words that I don’t typically use. Apparenty I will be summoned to court on Friday.

I am trying to stop using and do get time up but then I relapse and this psychosis comes back but it comes in a way which is a continuation of the story not a reset which makes me think this is really all happening.

Then I hit a relatively low patch and got into something I had never really experienced. Extreme binging and making myself throw up. This is HELL. This is the WORST addiction I have had to deal with and it's ruining my body and my brain, bank and life. 

I was doing REALLY good and was even in probably the best place I've been in in years last month. But a bad heart break threw me off completely.

I'm talking spending 2000 in a week on food to eat and throw up. It's been a month. I called out of work for a week because I was so desperate to stop the cycle but I have to go back in tomorrow and I'm panicking.

I cannot undo all my hard work. I have no money for therapy. I feel good ugly to go outside. I can hardly shower. I know if I keep going I'm going to lose my mind and harm myself. I don't really have any support or friends. I don't know what to do and I'm slip slip sliding 

I'm so desperate to stop that I've been genuinely thinking of getting coke or Adderall so I don't eat... How pathetic.

I haven't struggled with this in months and months and I'm terrified. I worked so hard to look and feel good. I know if I get back on it I'll be back where I was in a month or two which is okay.

But I can't go back to the gym if I hate how I look. I can't leave my house or shower or function AT ALL. IM TERRIFIED BECAUSE IVE BEEN HERE BEFORE.
can anyone please help. I don't know what to do.

I am so so bloated and just depressed. I throw up so much that, and this is really gross and embarrassing I feel so much shame. But I piss myself. And I'll just keep going.

1jpzjt3,2025-04-02 20:53:51,addiction,I am 23 years old and addicted to approval. Is anyone else addicted to using external validation to feel good? How did you get better?,"I’ve known I relied way too much on what other people think of me since like 14 years old. I have journaled about it, I've swallowed self-care videos and podcasts like daily vitamins, I’ve told myself ""Today is the day I will not care. Today is the day I will radically love myself"", and I have adopted affirmations to remind myself of my own self-worth, but the same thing happens every time: as soon as I stop journaling or speaking to myself in the mirror or turn off the video, I go about my day and I fall into the same patterns of thinking and suffering until I stop, reflect and come to the same conclusion I had three journal entries ago. The need for other people to confirm what I am doing or to approve of what I am doing is so strong within me that I don’t know what to do.

I can tell you why I desire people’s approval; I can describe every event throughout my childhood that taught me that I was someone to be ashamed of, and how having someone laugh at my joke or agree with something that I said or gaining praise from a high grade, filled me up in a time when I was overly criticized and lonely, but I can't figure out how to let go of it.

I have aspects of myself that I like, traits I can list off- I have a good job, I’m not hideously ugly, I'm kind and understanding to most I meet, I have close friends and a reasonable relationship with my family- I just can’t figure out why my self-satisfaction is not enough. It’s like if I look in the mirror and think I look good, that’s cool, but if someone else compliments me when I’m out and about, I can’t stop smiling about it for like a week straight. Flossing every night, adopting a skincare routine, and going to the gym once a week (which I plan on increasing once I have more free time) were easy in comparison to this. How can I be alert of what I am thinking and what I am motivated by every moment of the day? As soon as I drop my guard, I find myself doing and craving for others' approval. I know part of what I need to do is heal the shame I feel, but it feels like the shame I have for myself is so deep and so ubiquitous that it is overwhelming. It's not only in the thoughts I have (I think kinder things towards myself) but in my assumptions, my desires, my anger, my sadness. It feels unbeatable. It feels like I'm not doing enough. How can I correct every thought I have? How can I stay intentional with my thoughts throughout the day?

1jppldb,2025-04-02 14:13:36,addiction,Partner is Going to Rehab,"Context: in Ontario, Canada.

Hey guys. I’m a fellow addict myself and have been in recovery for over a year now. I’ve never went to treatment, just worked with my family doc/psych/pharmacist.
My partner, who I love so dearly, has been a more “serious” addict for 6 years. He first ended up in the psych ward for 2 weeks, then detox, and in less than an hour he’ll be at rehab for the first time for 28 days. I’m extremely proud of him and support him 100%. I want him to be sober and healthy of course.

I gave him some of my worn clothes to bring to cuddle and/or wear; a few Polaroids of us; and a pretty journal where I wrote all of the poems I’ve written about him, quotes I love, doodles & drawings, and letters.

It was difficult while he was gone to the psych ward & detox, but I could visit and we could speak on the phone daily. However, this rehab is strict. There’s no visitations and patients are only allowed one 10 minute phone call per week. Maybe this is the norm at rehabs, I’m not sure.

Anyways, I guess I’m just scared and worried. We’ve never been apart this long and I know it’s going to be difficult on us both. It’s going to be lonely. I have bpd and he’s my favourite person.

How have you guys coped while a loved one was in rehab and you had little to no contact during their stay? Does anyone have any advice/experiences they could share? Tyia!

TLDR: partner is going to rehab for a month where we will barely be able to have even phone contact. Scared, worried, not sure how to cope when he’s gone.

Thought I was gonna have a heart attack at xmas so I requested a referral to a cardiologist. 

He told me he's 99% sure that what I experienced was a heart muscle spasm and was in good shape currently but that my health will deteriorate rapidly if I continue due to my age and degree of usage.

He asked me why I use it.

I had many reasons to which he replied, I've dealt with many thousands of patients and at least 1,000 of them were addicts.

Do you know what they all had in common?

An inability to cope with intense childhood shame.

1jpadf9,2025-04-01 23:37:04,addiction,The chat that made me RETHINK success,"I had an interesting conversation the other day that's been stuck in my head ever since.

I was catching up with an old friend, who we'll refer to as James.

He's what most would consider wildly successful -- he's built and exited a massively successful company and is building another currently, has a beautiful home, the picturesque family.

Yet as we talked, I noticed his energy was low and his eyes looked tired.

And for better or worse, I don't shy away from the bigger questions.

So when I asked how things were really going, he paused for a moment.

Then, he finally said:

""I've achieved everything I set out to do... but some days I can barely drag myself out of bed.""

Despite his external results and the fact his life looked kinda ideal from the outside, it wasn't. He's been feeling increasingly disconnected from his wife over the years, and hasn't spent nearly as much time with his kids as he'd like over these years where he's been running on caffeine and stress.

And when I asked him what he does to cope with his stress, after a little digging past the surface-level responses, he revealed that he'd been using porn and alcohol as his primary ""stress relief"" for years.

In his words: ""I'm successful at everything except actually living.""

He *wanted* to be having more intimacy with his wife, spending more time with his kids, creating memories... but the reality of the situation has been really missing the mark.

This hit me hard because I've been there. Different circumstances, same fundamental issue.

Looking successful on paper while feeling empty inside.

Achieving goals that were nice, but didn't actually fulfill some of my deeper needs and desires.

And using escapism to dodge confronting that uncomfortable truth.

When I shared some of what helped me turn things around, he asked pointed questions. Dude actually listened super intently and even took a few notes.

This guy who's paid six figures to give advice was humble enough to recognize that something was off and he needed a different approach.

Three things became clear to me as we chatted:

1. External success without internal alignment is a hollow victory.
2. Even the most ""successful"" among us struggle with the same fundamental challenges. Status and wealth don't make you immune to disconnection, emptiness, or addiction.
3. A man who isn't fulfilled with and satisfied by how he's living isn't truly successful, at least not by my standards, regardless of how much he earns. There's more to life, and if our relationships, lifestyle, etc are out of whack then there's still a lot of work to be done.

It was a cool conversation.

Solid insights, and he's decided he's taking some major steps toward repairing things. Not by abandoning his career or achievements, but by reconnecting with what actually matters to him beyond wealth accumulation -- starting with his wife, and cutting down on that porn habit to help make those sparks fly again.

For men caught in similar patterns, this is often where real transformation begins.

Not necessarily with grand gestures, but with honest reflection and a willingness to change.

What areas of your life look successful on paper but feel empty in reality? And what might change if you redirected some of your energy toward creating a greater level of fulfillment?

Something worth considering.",7,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1jpadf9/the_chat_that_made_me_rethink_success/

It all started while I was in the Army. I attempted to end my life two times with no knowledge of why just the how. I have been put in the mental institution twice. I have tried to overcome my medical problems and to no avail. I have a constant need to use alcohol and cocaine. I should say I have a nicotine vape as well. Usually I have my episodes while on alcohol, I go through 3 phases. One of deep sadness, then extreme excitement and happiness, then anger and hate for everything. At the end of my episodes I feel miserable and want to end it all but I don’t. I feel like a coward for wanting to do that & put a burden on my family. 

Whenever I drink I am always home and don’t drink alone. I have done rehab & actively have a psychiatrist as well and therapist. In the end it always comes back to me drinking in secret & I’ll admit it isn’t a lot but it’s still a drink while in rehab. I’ve expressed my concerns to my facility and I have been able to maintain a period of abstinence but I always fall. 

My biggest issues are my relapse moments and I am afraid I might make a big mistake in my life. 
In the end all I ask for is for tips and tricks.

1jp4xns,2025-04-01 19:48:36,addiction,Lost my dad last year to addiction.,"Last May I had the unfortunate and upsetting news that my dad had died. The initial response was just total shock like it didn’t even feel real what I was being told. My dad’s side reframed a fair amount of the information regarding his death as they felt it would be too much for me, I managed to get the full story and found out that he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol and fell into a fishing lake and drowned in the middle of the night and his body wasn’t discovered till the next following morning which I believe was Thursday morning when his body was discovered. 

Now before Dad’s death I was brought up with a lot of drugs around me. When I was a teenager I had zero tolerance with drugs would never touch them or consider doing them. As I was enjoying my school activities and hobbies outside of school. I also understood the detrimental effects it has on that person and the people around them. Then when I went to college/uni I started experimenting a bit as most people do at that age and I found it really fun made me confident, made me forget the things in my life that was causing me stress, anxiety, it almost was like a type of medicine but only gives you a short term fix on the problem. FYI I am referring to the Class A drug Cocaine. 

Moving into the start of my adult years and cocaine is still something I’ve done on numerous occasions it starts off just once a month for big social event or celebration of some kind. Then before you know it that once a month has now jumped two times a month, then I start to think about it when i go to my local pub on a random Wednesday then all of sudden I’m fancying a bag. The crazy thing is why would I give into these impulses as I’ve literally seen what it did to my dad and the end result for him. But I still go ahead and do it. I’m aware of all the warning signs I know when it becomes a problem when you’re relying on substance I learnt that the hard way by having to look after an alcoholic all through my child hood. But I still decide to do it myself as well even tho I know full well how bad it can get. 

Since my dad’s death my intake of cocaine has gone up. It’s no longer for social events it’s just me on my own taking it just because i want it. Or I will finish work on a random Tuesday and I will already have it in my head that I am going to get a G when I go home. It’s not even social any more it’s just me isolating myself and doing coke on my own. Now I don’t know why the intake has gone up so much and maybe it is the grief of my dad’s death and I didn’t even notice I was taken more cocaine, maybe it’s a coping mechanism. But it’s gotten to a point now where i am starting to get worried as I feel like the codependency and the need for it is strong and I really don’t want to go down the same rabbit hole my dad went down, cause at the end of the day it’s death. 

Who ever got this far thank you for reading this. This is my first ever time putting something up on Reddit and of course It had to be something like this. I’m not really sure how this works if people can comment or help in any way but I just wanted to write it all out basically. 

Thank you.

1jp9ngm,2025-04-01 23:04:42,addiction,I disappeared entirely from my old life and relapsed after 6 months of sobriety,"I feel an overwhelming sense of guilt and shame after all the hard work I put into rebuilding my life.

I relapsed after six months of sobriety.

The weight gain from recovery, buried emotions, emotional numbness (PAWS/anhedonia), and the stress of dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic (non-drug-related) arrest all pushed me in this direction.

And yet, I’m proud of the moves I made these past six months. Every decision was guided by professionals and outside intervention.

I moved across the country after rehab, cut off countless people (actually, everyone), and completely disappeared from my old life.

But now, I feel like I’ve just gotten better at hiding my addiction. I’m not proud of that, but I also don’t want to go back to how things were.

I went from being homeless—living in a trap house—to being graciously reintegrated into my old professional job.

Then, I had a short but intense relapse.

I’m sober again now, but I’m horrified with myself.

So much bad sh*t happened in a row. I’m struggling to process how awful it got.

It feels like I was dealt a terrible hand. And then I made some really bad decisions that led to total life collapse… and addiction.

I took accountability for my role in all of it, rebounded from the impossible, and yet—here we are again.

The thing is, I like my life right now.

But I’m so confused with myself.

I have everything going for me. And I feel ashamed.

I feel very alone.

Feel like my childhood trauma + falling in with friends who did drugs very early in life (about 13 yrs old) has made me the way I am and idk what to do.

Tried CBT but basically got told I’m too fucked up for it and need to address my issues through counselling first which I’m starting next week. I’ve been unofficially diagnosed with anxiety and depression but I have always felt like there are way deeper issues which I have (likely due to growing up around alcoholics, multiple close family suicides/attempts, witnessing parents physical and mental abuse as well as sometimes being the victim of it, seeing parents get arrested, restraining orders etc.) and it is very hard to get a diagnosis in Scotland. I have worked so hard through my struggles to get educated with pretty much 0 support, and now that I am on my way up it’s like all this shit has hit me. I have always dabbled in drugs but never to this point, and I have been going on the way I am for a few months now.

\*Edit: To give some status as to the who, what, and why. I can't quit bc it makes all the pain from watching my wife's final moments, the memory is forever burned into my brain. She was my everything, and it was the worst night of my life forever. It makes me forget why I don't have my own house anymore, why I've been stuck at my parents for almost a year, why I didn't work for months or leave my house, until I got a job at my local vape shop one day when I was feeling better and had no success at landing any job. I was a former video editor and have worked for a few major companies. But it takes all I have to just pull my pants on and go to work, it does make me feel better and I love the job bc I'm injured from a car accident and currently getting medical help through a law firm, one of the reasons why I can't quit, super flexible and permanent hours with a super understanding boss, that's really hard to find nowadays. It sucks that I have users coming in to buy meth bowls or talking about hot railing if we don't, just them being there reminds me of how the rush feels. I started as an excuse that since I have ADHD and Adderall is not a potent but in the same family, so I would just use less and I would eat it or snort it to get that ADHD medication effect, that I've learned is a lie and always will be. Idk if Adderall really works with someone that has ADHD as severe as me it makes me focus and all that but not on stuff I need to, gives me energy, I have plenty of that, Klonopin slows my mind down, allows me to think and not talk over people, I do that on and off of ADHD meds or I'm a zombie that doesn't eat or socialize. Kinda how I felt as a kid when I was diagnosed with it and ASD-1. Just to be flat out here, I fucking hate my life, I hate everything, and none of it was my fault, I would have my house back and my wonderful wife, this took everything from me it destroyed me seeing her in her own creation, one second she was my wife now she's gone, it was like a fuck you to the world and me. She left her problems here when she did, and made 1000 more for everyone else, especially me, to escape that's why.

What do I feel like now? I can't stop scratching my beard and face, I have to stop myself from chewing on my lip and grinding my teeth. Sleep would be out the question without my Ambien (which I took about 20 min ago, current time 4:54am). Appetite, still almost non-existent I'm still forcing myself to eat and drink. I get in my car or room, basically anywhere I've used and I immediately take my phone out and turn on the flashlight and I gotta stop myself bc I'm looking for shards that aren't there. I feel like I wanna just rail a line or smoke a bowl to make these feelings stop. But I don't wanna chase the dragon anymore. I might be able to hide my habit now, but dependency is defiantly forming in some way.

Current age 33 I feel the slippery slope of addiction and relapse. To start off I'll begin with the first time I did meth wasn't intentional age 20, idk if my friend knew or didn't all I know is he called me told me he had some girl and if I wanna bang out some gators, hell yeah its Friday. He gets there and we always were smart and would use a bump tool to test it, see how good it was, or if it was actually coke, he said ""house rules, the host gets the first bump"", at the time someone I felt as being a close friend this wasn't ominous foreshadowing, if he knew, well I could tell 100% the instant that powder hit my nose that was not coke, then nearly immediately I felt like I was going lightspeed and I could do anything, I also knew that it was meth the way it burned was like molten dragon piss in powder form or something. I guess being the ""good"" friend, I say it with quotes bc he became an addict immediately after so I'm not sure, he was he said something like ""fuck dude, I guess Imma ride it with ya"" Then it was 2 days of gacked the fuck out, I hated it bc all I could do after he left for the next 8 hours was lay in bed and try to jerk off with zero result(clarity I doubt it was 8 hours, but it was long enough I'll say that). I guess you're all wondering how'd he not know by looking at it that it wasn't coke, well it was 100% shake-and-bake all white powder and not enough light for me to really tell, I know bc at the time and a few years prior I would cook and sell with a friends dad, I knew this was a good way to make quick money, but I promised I never do it bc I saw how just an average, not tweaker meth head looked, and trust me a lot of average users in my state look a step up from a well known website and project that posts a lot of before and after photos. A few years went by(24-25) and one night hanging out with 2 longtime close friends, I arrive and a pookie soon comes out, I just say fuck it and try it they roll it for me and I got a good strong hit, felt like the last time I did it honestly, I think it was either trash meth or they weren't they best at rolling(I'll get to why I think that soon), chilled with them from probably 830pm to 5am, was able to goto bed just fine. Woke up no cravings nothing, good to go like the last time. Nothing and I mean absolutely no amphetamine or meth use, I was very much against it. Flash forward 8 years give or take, May 12, 2024 my wife committed suicide right in front of me, she did not die from her final act and I tried to save her but I knew there was too much damage, I agreed with the doctor that with her 10% brain function and constant seizures, and on life support, my wife was no longer with me I would never have her back in anyway, so after 3 days I said okay to them taking her off, she took her last breath 27 min later. First everything was what you'd expect from that kind of grief and PTSD, my parents pay for my therapy bc I knew I wouldn't be able to function without it. Its been working fairly well since my therapist has PTSD from being in Global War on Terror as a combat medic, she was one of the first women they allowed to go on major combat missions during major pushes during the 2nd invasion of Ramadi, she saw a lot. So she only treats vets and suicide survivors like myself through EDMR style therapy and I go to group every month. Everything has been getting better very slowly but far better than almost a year ago. I have always smoked weed everyday so that's not new and my consumption didn't increase. I drank a little for the first month to month and a half after her passing but that like all the other habits I've ever had I can just go nah not anymore and I'm done no cravings, withdraws, etc. Now were gonna go to late February of this year I for some reason met out of ALLLLLL the meth users that come into my store to buy ""oil burners"" chose one guy to ask if he had some shard or could get some, he didn't look like your typical tweaker that would come in there, he was normal looking, acted normal, but was def a more than occasional user, he said yes and gave me his number, when I got paid a day later my dumbass went and got a gram from him, while I was there we smoked a bowl and I finally felt ""the flash"", didn't realize it that was set it's hooks into me. But I didn't smoke, I thought I could get away with snorting it and eating it in small amounts for a short time to fix my sleep, I absolutely did not do that. A week goes by of not doing any of that, get paid call him again to try again, smoked and then snorted the rest, no issues with eating or sleep but did not fix sleep schedule. Another week maybe week and a half go by and I call him again this time I did it bc I wanted some, mistake #1, I buy it and a bowl and smoke with him and while I'm going about my day but I still keep it minimal and I'm really shit about rolling a bowl so I burn it most of the time and decide to go back to snorting just more at a time. Few days go by and now I buy it to repeat the high, I spent the day with him fishing and smoking meth and bought 3 grams this time. I smoked all 3 grams in 5 days, I would account the first half a gram as wasted bc I burnt the shit out of it, then I turned to trusty reddit on how to properly smoke meth, well I sure as hell figured it out now and I was rolling almost perfect every time. And I smoked and I smoked during the 5 days I slept twice for about 10 hours total and ate 3 out of the 5 days and I did and always do stayed hydrated. Only this time when I ran out, it wasn't like the last 4 times where I just got sleepy and went to bed, I went into tweaker mode, carpet shard goblin and all. And about halfway though the day of this I'm finally like wtf are you doing? STOP NOW. Thank god for being prescribed an SSRI and Klonopin bc It's been 24 hours, I had a full day of sleep(10 hours) I ate 3 meals, been hydrating and I'm still having a hard time, still gritting my teeth, still craving finding myself when I go look for something I'll catch myself ""shard hunting"" for a second and I'm like dude fucking cut it out. Problem is this guy is a regular, and even though he'll be more than understanding about why I can't hang out with him anymore, I can't quit my job its not an option, but I can't stop the meth users coming in there to get bowls all the time or dude coming in to get cigs every other day. I have to keep this job and stay clean. Please give me advice on what to do and ways to mentally fortify myself, I don't want that crap about ""just stay strong"" or ""just say no""...duh, I wanna know what would you do as an ex user or addict in my shoes to prevent this, that's gonna give me a better idea on what to do. I know I can just I need your comments to be memories I can pull from to relate to bc it will give me strength.

1joo7rt,2025-04-01 05:31:21,addiction,A Letter to My Drug Addicted Mother,"Hello everyone. I hope all is well. My names Josie Kelley. I wrote my mom a letter after I had blocked her, and sent it by mail. She never ended up reading it. I want someone to see my heart. I know people in this community struggle with addiction. I know they struggle with many things. My heart goes out to all of you. Even if no one reads this, I want to put my heart on a platter from the daughters perspective of addiction. What I wrote below, it's what I desperately wished my mom knew when she thought I hated her.

Mama,

I know it’s weird to send a letter like this when we live in a day and age where phones and cars exist. I know I’ve made it hard for you to get in contact with me in those ways, but I needed to get my feelings out. Lately, and probably a lot of my life, it’s been hard for us to communicate with each other. Maybe it’s because we’re the only girls, or that we’re so alike, or maybe it’s just simply how life goes for two people who feel things so deeply. I hope you’ll read my full letter and its entirety. I had to type it out because I have a lot in my heart that I wish I could tell you. I have a lot of things that I want to get off of my chest. Please take the time to read it. I want to start off by telling you how much I love you, mama. I love you so much that sometimes I stay up at night and cry thinking that one day I’ll never see you again. I’ll cry thinking about how I haven’t seen you and that I miss you. I miss you so much. I don’t think I could put into words how I feel about you, mama. Out of every person on this Earth, I love you the most. I feel so complete when I’m with you. To me, you’re my safe place, you’re my home. You make me so happy, like a warm childish feeling. I could go without everything in the world if that meant I could be with you. I know I could handle losing some people, but I can’t handle losing you. I don’t ever stay up praying for someone like I stay up to pray about you. I don’t ever miss anyone but you. I don’t ever cry over being away from anyone but you. You mean so much to me, I don’t know how anyone could live without you.

Despite what you might think, I tell everyone how amazing my mama is, and how wonderfully she raised me. When I moved out, I cried myself to sleep every night because I wanted to be at home with you. I know that may sound conflicting to you because I’m the one that decided to leave, but I couldn’t stay there anymore. I wish that things were a bit more simple. I wish things were a lot more black and white between us. Between everyone in our family. Out of every person, I feel a connection to you that I can’t even begin to explain. I love my mama. I love you so much. I feel in my heart that you’re the most special woman in the world. You’re the most kind, the most funny, the most caring, the most beautiful, the most warm, and the most amazing person ever to exist. Despite how you may think I feel towards you, in my heart of hearts, you have all of me. You truly are the one who taught me how to love and to be loved. You did everything you could for me. You are everything to me. I love you with all of my soul that it hurts to think you aren’t here with me like you used to be. I wish we still had our family together. I think about you all the time. I know you think I talk badly of you, but if there's one thing I can say, it’s that I don’t want anyone thinking wrongly of you. When you do something, I know I can understand it. I know I can see what you were trying to do. Even though I can’t show you that, that’s how I feel in my heart. It’s so hard for me to show you any vulnerability or sympathy. It’s so hard for me to give you the comfort you need when you’re sad. It’s so hard for me to tell you that I know what you’re going through. I know I can feel your struggle, I don’t want anyone to get the wrong impression of you no matter what you’ve done. They don’t know you like I know you, why would I tell them anything that you did? Why would I bad mouth you? You hold so much of my heart Mom. I want our family to love each other. I don’t tell all of the drama to Justin like you think, or vice versa. We rarely speak about family.

How could I tell people who don’t understand you anything negative about you? You’re wonderful. You’re amazing. You’re truly the apple of my eye, mama. You are the best thing to ever happen to me. Why would I want someone else to think you weren’t precious? I don’t tell anyone anything. I don’t go out of my way to ruin things for you. I don’t go off and tell everyone the drama. I don’t think I’m better than you. I could never be the woman that you are or go through the things that you have. You are so strong. You are so thoughtful and willing to help others. You are very selfless. Why would I think I’m better than you? I know you feel like I think that, but it’s just not true. I look up to you in many ways, I know that you’re trying your best to keep everything together and I know that you’re the only one doing that. I would never think I’m better than you. You’re living a hard life. You’re doing very emotionally draining things. How could I think I’m better than you when you do something so rigorous? You’re a strong woman. A beautiful woman. You are a prize to be treasured. There’s no such thing as someone better than you. You have to believe me for a moment when I say that. There's not a part of me that looks down on you, or Dad, or Colbie in the sense that I believe I’m better. I think a lot of times, the two of us get lost in translation. We go off of what we believe the situation is rather than what it truly is. I don’t think I’m more righteous than you. I wish I could do more for you. I wish I could help you and make you happier. I wish I could be someone you could rely on more. I’m sorry I couldn’t give you that comfort. I’m sorry I’ve turned you away so many times. I’m sorry for all the times that I’ve been ungrateful. I’m sorry for being so rude to you and being so mean to you, mama. I’m sorry for not appreciating you more or making you feel like you weren’t good enough. I’m sorry for not giving you a shoulder to cry on or giving you the comfort you needed. I’m sorry that I wasn’t able to hold you when you needed it. I’m sorry for hurting your feelings intentionally and all the many times I did it unintentionally. You deserved a tender heart from me, but I was blind a lot of times to my words or to how you felt. I was blinded by my own pain and anger. I’m sorry for any time I’ve lied to you, any time that I’ve made you feel unhappy, any time that I made you feel like I was looking down on you. I’m sorry for anything I’ve done to come against you or hurt you. I’m so sorry from the bottom of my heart. I’m sorry, mama.

I want you to be happy. I wish I could have been a lot better in the times where I wasn’t good enough. I want nothing but the best for you. I wish that I could take all of your pain away and I wish that I could press a button and have all of our issues wiped away, I wish our family could go back to normal. In this letter, I may say some things that you don’t agree with, but please, for me, please just read what I have to say. Please. I know things in our lives have taken a turn for the worse and it’s like a rollercoaster continuing to push forward in the wrong direction. Our family fell apart so quickly that it was hard to stop it. In reality, when I think about it, it’s all in slow motion. The slow grinding down of every one. I know that our family has struggled with many things, and I know that it’s hard to pinpoint it all. I come to you earnestly mom, I just want you to be honest with me. I just want you to give me some closure and something real. I need that from you Mom. Please. Please allow me this. I know. I know about a lot of things. I know and I don’t know. I know there are things that I’ll never know. You need to be honest with yourself. I know. I’m not trying to judge you, Mom. I’m not trying to hurt you. I just want my mama back so badly. I know you think it’s fine and I know you think things aren’t caused by what you’re doing. But they have been for a long time. This letter isn’t about Dad, but I know he's done more than his fair share of it too. It’s not that I’m just blaming you mama, but you don’t understand what I feel for you. I don’t feel the same things with Dad. I know it feels like I always let him off the hook or am being nicer to him, but it’s because I don’t expect him to do anything else. I expect so much from you because I know what you’re capable of. 

I don’t understand it myself. I don’t know why it’s so much easier to talk to Dad, or why it feels like I can forgive him so easily when I know deep down he’s nothing compared to you. Don’t get me wrong, I love Dad to pieces, but you... You were my mom and my dad for so much of my life. You were always there for me and raised me in the most loving, gentle, and warmest way possible. You did it perfectly, mama. I’m so proud of you. You held me when I cried, you rubbed my feet when they hurt, and you kissed my knees when I fell. You stayed with me. You loved me, you nursed me back to health when I was sick, you made me laugh when I was sad, you played games with me when I was bored. How could anyone be a better mother than you? You’re my person. It’s so much harder for me to forgive you. It’s so much harder for me to speak to you freely. It’s so hard for me because I just want to express to you how much I love you but I can’t help but hold things against you. I can’t help but be mad at you. I’m sorry about that. Something different about him, he’ll be honest with me, even if it’s just a little. He’ll apologize because he knows he’s an addict. An alcoholic. You’re so much more than these drugs, mama. Then those people who are claiming to have your back. Dad is more than the alcohol and addiction too. But you're something special mama. You’re so special. You’re like diamonds and gold, how can anyone be better than you? You’re more than all of this. You’re my world. I can’t help but hold everything against you because I want my mommy so badly. I want the mother who had that soft heart. I want the mother who wasn’t weighed down by the world. I want you. I want you back. I know that these drugs talk for you a lot of the time. I know it feels like you’re in a car with no breaks. I know things are happening so naturally around you that it’s hard to think that these drugs are the issue. I know that mama. I don’t blame you for being addicted. I don’t blame you for hustling. I don’t blame you for living the life that you feel was dealt to you. I don’t blame you for those things, and I don’t hold them against you. I don’t think you’re a bad person. I don’t think you’re disgusting. I don’t think you’re worthless. I don’t think that you’re unsavable. You’re more than any drug in this world, any lifestyle in this world. I don’t blame you for those things. I blame you for not facing those facts though. I blame you for not being honest with yourself and with me. I blame you for not having the dignity to realize that you’re not hiding the truth from anyone. You hurt others more by simply pretending you aren’t doing what you are. If you aren’t ashamed to do it in secret, you shouldn’t be ashamed to do it openly. I know. It’s not hard to tell. I can tell when you’re high. I can tell when you’re sober. I can’t tell every time you lie, but I know you do. Please just be honest with me. Please show me that. Please, mama.

I have suffered a lot in my childhood, but I know many people have. I have gone through a lot of pain in my life, but I know many people have. I know that things and life aren’t always normal. I wish you could be honest with me. If you would give me that, it would be so much easier for me to forgive you and have us move on. We don’t have to live like this forever. Our family doesn’t have to suffer forever. It starts with being honest. You need help. There's nothing wrong with that. I just want things to change and move on from this, I want to grow our lives and be together again. I want to come over to the house and feel welcomed again. I want to see you and feel loved again. I want to hold you and feel like a kid again. I want to show you my heart and not feel scared that you’ll get high again. I want you to leave the drugs behind. I want you to be able to start a new life that you can actually be happy in. I want you back. I want these drugs to die and go to hell.

I know that when I moved out, you had a lot of thoughts about it. I know you thought someone was influencing me. The truth of that is Mom, I’m hardly swayed by others. Every time I confront you or try to talk to you about things that have happened, you always act like its other people who tell me what to say, but that’s simply not true. I have never been moved to say something I don’t believe. I have never been moved to hate you. People don’t talk about you as much as you think they do. When I would come over here to Nana's house before I moved out, none of us would speak on you or whatever situation was going on. We moved out to get away from all of that. I have always driven my own ship. I have always formed my own opinions. Nothing I have ever said to you was brought out by someone else. Justin never talks badly of you, in fact, he only talks about how much he loves you and wishes you would get the help you need. Same for Nana. We defend you more than most people do. It’s not fair for you to blame us in that way. When everything happened after the 4th of July, it wasn’t anyone else’s choice but my own to leave. I had warned you for months that I was going to move out if you and Dad didn’t change, but nothing happened. You didn’t believe me.  I told you in December that things needed to change or I wasn’t staying. The months went on. I tried to bring it up but nothing ever happened when I did. January, nothing. February, nothing. March, nothing. April, nothing. May, nothing. June, nothing. I couldn’t take it anymore. Both you and Dad refused to get the help you needed. The help I begged you to get. I want you to be happy Mom. I want you and Dad to change for the better. I’m sick of this life we seem to be stuck to. The last two years of our lives have felt like... honestly, hell. Alcohol, drugs, anger, violence, manipulation, and more have infested the structure of our family. I wanted change. I needed it. I begged for it. I tried to talk to you about it, I tried to warn you about it, but you would turn me away and get mad. You told me that I wasn’t going to move out. I realized you told me that you wanted the same change as me just so I’d shut up. You guys didn’t even falter when I told you I would leave. You were shocked when I actually did and blamed everyone but yourselves. You and dad. You had six months.

Do you think I wanted to move out mom? Do you think as a 17 year old that I wanted to pay my own bills? To burden the people around me to take me back and forth to work and school? To make all of my choices by myself? Do you think I wanted to be away from my home and my family? I was a child.. I forced myself to grow up and get somewhere that didn’t feel like a house of darkness and depression. I’ve done so much myself and I deserve some credit for that. I don’t deserve you blaming me for leaving. I don’t deserve you treating me like some spoiled brat. I don’t deserve you treating me like I think I’m better than you because I want more for myself. I didn’t deserve how much you guys put on me. I’m your daughter, not your emotional scapegoat. I’m not the one that’s supposed to bring happiness to the house and carry the burden of everyone's depression either. I don’t deserve you belittling me. I handle EVERYTHING on my own. I do EVERYTHING on my own. 

I tried my hardest to keep our relationship after I moved out. I’m the one who came to see y'all, I’m the one who called and texted y'all, I’m the one who forgave y'all. You guys wouldn’t let it go, you guys wouldn’t treat me equally, you guys made me feel like an outsider. That wasn’t fair to me. For the first month after moving out, it felt like I was mourning my family. It felt like I was mourning you. I cried and cried and cried. I laid in bed and sobbed myself to sleep every night because I didn’t have my mom. I want you back mom. I don’t want the drugs. I’ve forgiven you time and time again, the least you could give me is a little respect and honesty. If you want to be honest with me, I’ll always listen. I’ll never judge what you’ve done. If you lie to me again, I’ll continue to push you away. Trust is earned in droplets and lost by buckets. You have lost my trust. I love you. If you want to get in contact with me after you’ve read this entire letter, reach out through someone to let me know. If not, we’ll continue no contact. I love you, mama. I love you so so so so so much. I love you. I miss you. I wish things could heal between us, but I can’t be the only one healing it. I want you in my life. I need my mom. I need my dad. I need my parents while they're still around. I beg you mom. I beg and plead. I need you guys so badly. I just want to be with you guys. I just want yall to love on me and love me. Everyday it feels like I’m mourning the person that I love the most. I want my mom back. I want my dad back. I just want you guys to be happy and healthy. I want you guys to get away from whatever is holding you back. I want only the best for yall. I love you. I pray to God to keep you safe and help you to be happy. Please read this letter earnestly. Bye mom.

1jobzla,2025-03-31 19:37:26,addiction,Sober,"Today is 252 days sober from fent. After 4 long years of addiction i finally got sober. July 21st is my sobriety date and it's crazy to think it will be a year soon. I'm back to working, seeing family/friends, paying my bills on time with some money left over. I'm thankful to be where I am today. 
If anyone thinks they cant get better, you will.
I will admit, i am on methadone and have been the whole time I was using. I'm using the way it was intended now and going down 10mg every 3 weeks. Im at 60mg right now and was at 108 in July. I was scared to cut back, being sick is what kept me on the drug for so long. 
I was only getting from one person and he got locked up for a week, after 1 day i was already puking and tried from someone else. My anxiety is so bad, that one bag had me thinking i was about to die. I never wanted to OD and thankfully never did before. In that moment i decided im not doing any other bags until he comes outta jail. I stuck with my methadone for 2 days and craving a bag. Was cleaning my box so i could find straws to scrape and I find one brand new bag. Felt like i found $1000. I told myself this was it, watever craving i had this would have to fulfill it. I did it, felt good, and never touched another one since. 
Felt like i had the closure i needed too.

1joenza,2025-03-31 21:26:42,addiction,Xanax Addiction,"I hate this stuff so much. I had been on benzos on and off for 20 years, mainly Klonopin which was much easier to titrate off of.

I was on Klonopin but got switched to Xanax over a year ago back when Klonopin manufactures were all on back orders. So my Dr switched me to Xanax 2mg 3x a day the same dose of Klonopin I was prescribed except I was only actually taking the Klonopin 2mg 2x a day. 

I just want to get off of this stuff so bad. I beat a heroin addiction that I had but this stuff to me is harder to kick than heroin. 

I have a refill on my Xanax next week and appointment next month. I’ve been contemplating scheduling my appointment earlier before my refill to get it switched over to Klonopin again so I can start lowering my dose. In my experience Klonopin was always much easier to taper off of but this Xanax doesn’t last long at all. I take it and read about all the negative stuff and a few hours laster take another 2mg pill to where it’s up to 6-8mg a day now.

I am scared because I don’t have resources for rehab, I have a job, a life and everything is great but this medication is ruining everything. I want to schedule my appointment this week before my upcoming refill to ask my Dr to cancel it to switch it back to Klonopin instead of Xanax because I don’t want to do another month of this and wait til my 3 month follow up with him.

I get weird anxiety that in make it early right before my refill he is gonna cut me off which I know is illogical and just my anxiety because cutting some off of 6mg of Xanax a day is life threatening. I don’t know if I should go in this week show him I’m still taking them and have the remaining pills I should until my refill and so him to cancel it and switch it with Klonopin or just try and cope with it another month and go to my regular 3 month follow up.

My rebound anxiety in the morning is so bad sometimes I have to call off work. I had to call off today or sometimes I’ll set my alarms for 6:45am to take my meds, then have my second one set for 7:30 so when I wake up I don’t feel so awful. 

I don’t know what to do, benzos should not be detoxed in an inpatient setting because it’s a long monthly process

1jobixg,2025-03-31 19:18:23,addiction,Just some thoughts from my past journey and things I wish somebody told me.,"I'm not sure how to start this, but it's something I am grateful I finally found out when I hit rock bottom.

I have been you. You've tried everything you can think of and you've failed. Night and day you fight with the demons inside you. You wrestle with your own brain and you wish you could win. But how can you outsmart yourself? How can you overpower your own brain? It knows what your plan is, where you're going, when you're tired and weak and unable to fight. And no matter how long you make it, how long you are good for, how long you fight—it's never enough. Eventually, you will fail. And they will be right. You can't beat it, and you are a failure for it.

Well, I'm here to tell you—they're right. Tada! Turns out we are failures, and we can't get it right, and we will never be able to fix it. We suck at fixing it. And honestly, the feeling to give up trying isn't 100% wrong. But it is like 5% wrong.

What it's missing is the fact that there *is* a way out. The little 5% gap where it is possible to change.

Now the problem? That 5% is in different places for each person. But I can tell you where it's *not* at. That's pretty much the same for everyone:

- It's not in praying harder.
- It's not in hoping harder.
- It's not in sheer willpower or strength.
- It's not in distance from the problem.
- It's not in new patterns of self-destruction.
- And it's definitely not accepting your fate as an addict.

I've tried all of those—repeatedly, in different ways and flavors and combinations. They all lead to the same feelings of shame and fear and hurt and hopelessness and depression and anxiety and sadness and hate.

Now, while that escape from addiction is going to be different for every person in every process, the fundamental power behind it will always be the same:

You have to quit lying.

- Lying to yourself about being able to fix it.
- Lying to others about how bad it is.
- Lying about where you are and what you're doing.
- Lying about the effects it has on you and the things you care about.

The worst shame of it all is being caught in these lies.

I promise you—*the lies about it hurt worse than the addiction itself.*

---

Now, I can't tell you where your path leads. I don't know your specific issues and circumstances. But I do know how I got out, and the general things that allowed me to do so.

I hit rock bottom one day, and at 4 in the morning in a stranger's bathroom, I sent a text out to everybody that I had been lying to about my issue—my now ex, my religious leader, and my therapist.

I then spent the next month telling everybody that was connected to me and my addiction—my parents, siblings, friends, roommates—everybody I could think of that I had lied to. And let me tell you, that was the beginning of the end.

So far, I've been in an addiction recovery program for over a year. I have a stretch of sobriety, but honestly, that part doesn't even matter to me anymore. Sobriety days are just a number.

Don't get me wrong, I find sobriety to be very important in my life, but it's not what I was working toward. I was working toward breaking free of the addiction. And I have. I am not tied down to the shame and the lies. I have nowhere left to hide—and I love it. And it all came from leaving behind the lies.

Now, I highly recommend therapy. I think it's the best way to go about reconstructing your life. But you have to go in willing to be broken down, ripped apart, rearranged, and then rebuilt.

And if you can, join a support group. Find a group where you all have experienced somewhat of the same background and share. You’ll all find that even if it's not the exact same experience, you can understand where the problems are coming from—and why you're each struggling with them.

But if that's not for you, then find *somebody*. Just one person.

Someone you can tell *everything* to. Every excruciating detail. Every terrible thing you've done. Every hole you've found yourself in.

You have to get it out of you. You have to quit giving it the power to control you from the shadows.

So go get it done. You can't fix it, but you sure as hell can find somebody who can help you. Quit hiding, quit running, quit trying to lone-wolf it. Let yourself get ripped apart and fixed, and then you can go about your life how you wish it was.

—Just some guy on the internet

1joev6u,2025-03-31 21:35:02,addiction,The Inner Secret,"There's something you don't want to look at.

Something ugly and uncomfortable that you aren't proud of.

Maybe it's the way your relationship is going. Maybe it's drinking a bit too much. Maybe it's the hours you spend browsing YouTube and playing mobile games that just leave you feeling empty and like you've wasted your vitality afterward. Maybe it's that p\*\*n habit that's still not under control.

Regardless of what it is, it's normal for your brain to feel resistance towards taking a deeper look at these uncomfortable, yucky situations you may be facing.

But where most guys go wrong is they let that resistance stop them.

And interestingly, that pretty much guarantees that the yucky, uncomfortable bullshit will perpetually be a plague for them. Nothing significantly changing, certainly not for the better, often for years on end...

On the other hand, I've seen a certain type of guy.

They're the kinds of guys I love to work with 1-on-1, and they're also the kinds of guys who are actually my friends in the real world too. Guys who are willing to take a good look at themselves and work on any aspect of themselves that needs some attention, regardless of the discomfort it may make them feel.

Because they know a secret:

That if they feel a lot of resistance towards something *that they objectively know would be good for them,* then that's exactly where they should be looking, and they lean into that resistance.

Making themselves take a closer look, even if it hurts.

So I invite you to adopt that kind of mentality.

If there's something you've been avoiding because it feels yucky and uncomfortable and you wish it wasn't the way it is... well, the way to change it is to own it and face it.

""If I ignore it for long enough it'll go away..."" is a loser's mentality that just flat out isn't true, especially in the case of relationship disharmony and addictive tendencies.

What a lot of guys don't realize, either, is that their p\*\*n habit is sneakily connected to every one of the other most common things guys struggle with.

Let me explain.

Many men struggle to stay consistent in their disciplines - and if their brain's dopamine reward center is burned out from pornography, that's not surprising, because consistency relies on a healthy dopamine reward center that's functioning as it should.

Many men struggle with connection in their relationships - and p\*\*n trains them to satisfy their own needs without a real partner being involved, undercutting their partners and their potential partners with a pixel-harem that'll do anything they want at the tap of a finger.

Many men struggle with anxiety - and p\*\*n is something that fundamentally fractures their self-esteem and confidence, causing that anxiety to spike after they indulge.

Many men struggle with spending way too much time on technology - and that's a form of escapism that's reinforced by using p\*\*n, too. If your brain's reward center is desensitized to the normal pleasures of life, because it's used to the ""super-high"" stimulation of p\*\*n, it basically won't want to engage with those ""normal"" aspects of your lifestyle as much, preferring the screen or the booze or the whatever that give it quick, easy dopamine and escapism.

Which is why quitting p\*\*n is one of the cornerstone steps in the modern man's self-improvement journey.

Because leaving that self-destructive habit in place negatively influences all the other areas that are worth giving a shyt about.

And removing it, conversely, helps uplift those areas.",0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1joev6u/the_inner_secret/

1jne219,2025-03-30 14:49:57,addiction,Former long term heroin addict: Benadryl withdrawal is the next worst thing,"
Putting this out there because it is not widely known. Benadryl (diphenhydramine) withdrawal for some people can be nearly as bad as long term opiate withdrawal. 

I was a daily heroin addict for 5 years. I have used Benadryl as a sleep aid at different times in my life. Withdrawals from Benadryl can be nearly as bad as heroin withdrawal, including delirium and psychosis. I have had two friends who became psychotic and suicidal from it and had to be hospitalized. 

The fact that people can walk into any shop and start taking it nightly without any warnings or doctor’s oversight is a real shame. Most people have no idea what they’re getting into and don’t find out until it’s too late. Some never make the connection. 
 
You can google search for peer reviewed medical papers on it, just providing some first-hand testimony here, and a word of caution.

1jnkl1p,2025-03-30 19:37:23,addiction,"21 Days rule really works, I met my amazing GF because of this and saved my finance.","Hi Guys, 

I am 26 Male, I work as Data scientist, I earn in 6 figures, being a Data Scientist is great, I love analyzing stuff. This is one of the main reasons I became a gambling addict. 

I though analyzing the patters and predicting according to the calculation will bring me big rewards and it did for some time. But as all things go I started loosing, at first it was small, like I would win 3 times and loose once, which is a great thing right. But that once became twice and I started loosing more than I earned. But then myaanalytic brain started to work and then started to invest big amount because I was certain even if I win once out of twice I will be getting profit because of the ratios. 

As you guys may guess after certain period of time I started to loose soo much that I lost count of, this has been going on for 2 years, I don't even know how much I lost, I would run out of money at the month end and would borrow money from parents, friends to make ends meet that month, I would of course return next month as soon as I get my salary, only to my friends and not parents, yes I took advantage of that. Thinking back, I am disgusted on myself. 

Everything changed 6 months back, I got a bonus on my job (it was a big amount, almost 6 months of my salary), I never spoke about my bonus to my friends or my parents and yes I gambled with that money, I literally lost 6 months worth of my salary in just 1 week, yeah in 7 days. That was the deciding moment when I realized I was addicted to gambling. I logged out of all gambling sites and uninstalled all the apps. This was the first time in 2 years where I lost all my money in first week of the month. I made sure I would not place a single bet or even open those sites till end of month. I would not borrow money from my friends and just borrow enough from my parents that would last me till the end of the month. 

2nd week was really tough, I was fighting a battle within myself to not borrow money from friends and place bets. But I started to realize few things that changed, I was more happy and slept peacefully, I started to exercise more to distract my mind. At the end of the month it was almost 22 days, I never felt like gambling. The best thing that came out of this was me falling in love with sports again. I never felt like watching games as soon as I ran out of money, but here I was enjoying games without even thinking about placing bets. 

I confessed to my parents everything that happened and how I overcame it. My parents moved in with me for sometime to help me overcome it, they made me go to therapy which helped me a lot. They went back after I started making progress. Every month from then I send certain amount to my parents to invest in Mutual funds and other investments. 

Next few months I saved money, this helped me to join my friends on a luxurious New Year Eve party, where I met my current GF, she is an amazing person and I confessed about my previous addiction (you know in case I relapse) she was and still is very supportive and is helping me a lot to make sure I am completely out of this. 

So yeah, those 21 days literally saved my life and made me meet probably the love of my life (well it's been only 3 months so). 

Thanks a lot for reading my confession and trust me guys 21 days helps a lot. 

Let me know if anyone of you have gone through this and how you guys came out of addiction

1jnhyxc,2025-03-30 17:44:35,addiction,Help with addictions!!!,"Hello,
I’m a 37-year-old man dealing with several addictions, and I’m seeking advice.

Addictions:

Weed
Porn
Masturbation
Phone usage
(And occasionally, alcohol)

Background:
Porn: I’ve been consuming porn since I was 16 and have never had a healthy relationship. Even after meeting my wife at 30, I never stopped, and the usage fluctuated.

Weed: Started at 27. It increased my libido, leading to more porn use and masturbation.


Relationship with Wife: I’ve always felt less physical attraction to my wife than I would consider normal, even though I deeply admire her personality. She is funny, witty, caring, smart, empathetic, sensible and a movie buff like me. I know she is objectively good-looking—though not like someone I used to admire before I met her. Despite that, I love her deeply. Our sex life has suffered, partly due to my low testosterone, varicocele, and weed usage. I regret how I’ve let this affect us, and I can’t help but feel guilty for being selfish.


Family: I love my wife and 18-month-old daughter deeply. I’m aware of my selfish nature and want to change for them.


Addiction: I’ve been struggling with my addictions for years, and my wife is tired of hearing me complain. I need advice and encouragement to break free.


Weakness: I’m mentally weak and often give in to temptation. I used weed during my wife’s pregnancy despite her requests not to, which led to a fight.


Phone Usage: While not excessive, I believe reducing phone usage could improve my stagnant career and overall life.


Attempts to Quit: I’ve tried many times to quit these habits but failed each time.


Work and Relationship Issues: I’m laid-back by nature, and my wife feels I don’t help enough at home, especially with a full-time job and a child. My low testosterone makes me tired, which is why I want to reduce phone addiction.


Career Depression: I don’t love my job and feel depressed about it. I plan to stay for at least 10 more years to secure a good future for my family.

I’d appreciate any advice or even just acknowledgment. I feel mentally weak, like the gambler in Dostoevsky’s novel, struggling with these addictions.",1,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1jnhyxc/help_with_addictions/
1jneqlx,2025-03-30 15:21:26,addiction,"Anyone experience ""withdrawal dreams?""","For context, I was addicted to opioids for more than a decade. Hard-core, terrible addiction. Relapsed many times. I'm 2 years, 2 months, 1 week, and 1 day sober today. 

Here's my question: has anyone else experienced incredibly vivid dreams while going through withdrawals or going cold turkey? Like dreams that you still remember now that you're sober and kind of.. haunt you? I feel like this has to be a phenomenon others have experienced but I've never known who to ask about it, and didn't feel AA/NA meetings were the place to get answers from a wider audience. 

I had these dreams several times when I either went cold turkey, or ran out of my DOC, or before ""coming to"" after a bad bout of withdrawal. Many times they were so vivid, I'd have a hard time after trying to discern if parts of these dreams had actually happened. And this part is hard to describe but... sometimes I think of these dreams in a really nostalgic way, almost like I miss living in that weird ""dream state"" after, where I was convinced some of these things had actually happened. I apologize if all this is nonsense, I guess I'm just hoping someone will say, ""I know exactly what you mean and feel the same way about my dr*g dreams."" Because sometimes when I'm drifting off to sleep, it's comforting to think of these hyper-realistic things that never actually happened to me, but *feel* like they did.

And once I get a supply, something in me refuses to stop until it's all gone, used. I can't even convince myself to flush it. I don't know where this ""I ain't a quitter"" bullshit came from in my head, but I can't shake it. I am out, again. Used way fucking more this time. What normally would've lasted two weeks only lasted four days. The last several times have been the same. My therapist and my case worker keep trying to help me with harm reduction, but I've come to realize that just don't work with me. If I have stuff, I'm gonna use it. And if I have money when my cravings get bad, I'm gonna get stuff. I don't even have my numbers saved, I just know the places to go.

Did NA for a while. Got a bunch of numbers. Tried for the 90 in 90, but only got to 26 in 28. Every number I called or texted never responded back. Hell, I'd stick around after every meeting to try to talk to someone, but they were always too busy with their friends. I got two people to talk to me for a little bit. They still didn't respond to texts. And I never did find anyone willing to sponsor. Tried five different rooms. Idk. Maybe I have a weird vibe. Fuck if I know. My friends like me, my girlfriends like me. The people at NA, not so much. Lol.

Anyway, I've been off shit for four days (as of today). After the last bit, I finally crashed out and slept for a day and a half. Still getting things back into a semblance of a schedule. And I got a lot of things coming up this week. My partners are gonna be here for a few days, and I got a wedding I'm going to this weekend. I got money coming, too. Not sure that's a good thing. I mean, yeah, gotta pay the bills. But there's always just enough left over to ruin my life a little more. I mean, I guess it's not like I got a lot of time left, anyway. My degenerative neurological disorder is eating away at what's left of my body, already. Least when I'm loaded, I don't feel the pain as much.

I almost got her back and relapsed about two weeks ago. I hate myself for the harm I caused my child sometimes I feel she be better off without me. She almost 2 now 


Ever since I lost all access to my child, all I’ve wanted to do was die. I spent all week trying to OD on fentanyl, but it wouldn’t work because of my tolerance. So I acquired other drugs, I figured a good mix of Methadone and benzos would take me out. It’s a lethal combo. I also was gonna mix it with gabapentin, Seroquel, and whatever else. But now that I finally have all the drugs I’m not as sad and suicidal. I still miss my baby, but I’m starting to have a hope that maybe I can change and be a good mother but at the same time I’ve had this hope before and I’ve always fallen apart. I’ve been a heroin since I was 17 , I’m 26, and I’m just so tired of fighting so tired of the cycle of homelessness of rehabs of doctors of dcfs taking my baby over and over again , of jails , short periods of sobriety, just to do it all again . , when I’m sober sometimes I’m happy, but I’m mostly fighting the urge not to use , and when , I can’t live my whole life fighting the urge not to use, and I can’t live my whole life in the rehab jail homelessness thing either , I’m just done, I don’t know what to do, I feel like I’m gonna regret it in the future if I don’t kill myself now, but for some reason, I have a little hope today.

the thing is, if my life DIDNT fall apart, i wouldnt have hit 30 days. i could barely hit two-three weeks sober. i thought that sober = miserable. today i am grateful to be sober for 30 days. i'd say ""only"" but we all have to start somewhere. sobriety feels peaceful for the first time in over a year. i'm not littered with constantly wanting to relapse, thinking drugs were the only way to feel better.



 i kept thinking there was no negative consequences. that i just needed to learn to cover up my use more, needed to hide more, because it only negatively affected those around me. i thought i was acting the same. i was so deep in denial to what drugs were doing to my life i became delusional. it was so hard to face reality that the exact reason i was doing so bad was addiction. its like i knew but i didnt. i continually blamed my issues on depression, my depression was an excuse to keep using. 

  
i believe in some sort of god. to me it really felt like the downfall of losing all this money, losing my job, and developing vertigo all had a purpose. it had to happen. i went from oweing my bank $80 to $7 to having $17. i used to be horrible to my mom, ungrateful for everything. but she has been struggling for months financially because of the choice i made to put drugs over everyone else. but she has been here for me, she hasnt kicked me out, and despite being disappointed she has forgiven me. shes been giving me opportunities to make money. even $40 was something. 

  
i am doing so much better mentally. i feel like im coming up on my battle with addiction. im moving onto better days. i do need to take my ass to a meeting to be able to maintain this of course. im trying to kick myself to do online meetings because if i wanna keep what i have i have to put the work in. 

  
i thought drugs were what made me creative. but ever since i got sober, ive written a bunch. i am in a fandom right now on tumblr which has become a way for me to connect with people.. even people asying theyre EXCITED to read my fan fictions. or the sims i make, the edits i make etc. i'm actually writing a story right now. my creativity has INCREASED now that i dont want to only sit around doing nothing. now that i can have fun without drugs.

We are friends. He's not physically abusive, but he's just weird. I've begged him to go to therapy for almost 10yrs now. He struggles a lot with childhood trauma and abandonment issues. 

Last night, was the final straw. 
He had an extremely stressful day at work. He came home depressed and started drinking. We were talking at the kitchen table and he asked if we had any plans for the weekend. 
I reminded him I had a child (m/12) coming over on Sat to sleep over (it's my friends son. He passed away in 2021 and son is having a rough time.) His son also recently came out to me as gay. 

Immediately after telling him this my husband suggested I ask my nephew (m/21) who is also gay, to come over so they could ""hook up."" 

I flipped out and reminded him that my nephew is an adult man and child is only 12. He continued to say that he didn't know their ages, but still tried to justify that the age gap was normal. When I continued to yell and tell him to stop. He proceeded. He then made gestures with his hands(insinuating sex between the boys.) 

I told him I was going to call the police. That's when he stopped and went to bed. 

I slept on the couch and he came down at 2am asking what was wrong. I reminded him what he said. He continued to try and justify his words. He did apologize but I don't even want to look at him. I'm disgusted and I also don't want my friends son to come over now. WHAT DO I DO??

Both times involved her husband calling and texting nonstop asking when she'd be home. Brock is incapable of handling their children, even the smallest tasks or the shortest periods of time. He gets stressed out incredibly easily for a man who takes frequent solo vacations without the family. Oh yeah! That's right. He's Brock because this man child spends all of his spare money and time traveling around to Pokemon tournaments. Now I'm a nerd, my husband and I cosplay with our kids and go to cons together so I'm not calling him a man child for caring about Pokemon. He's a man child imo because he acts like Steph's fourth child

A few months back, I watched the older two for them for an overnight while Steph was in the ER with her youngest after he broke a bone at the playground. This guy apparently made her drive him to the airport before taking their son to the ER because he couldn't miss his tournament. Hearing that really annoyed me but I let it go because it was an emergency and I'm always happy to help my friends. The problem is that Steph has been calling and asking for help A LOT since then. 

Now I don't mind scheduling playdates or anything but every week there's something. Can I watch kiddo 2 so Steph can take kiddo 3 to this or that event? No, Brock can't watch him, he gets too overwhelmed. He's jetlagged. He's tired. He's overworked (9-5, M-F office job for reference). All of the reasons make sense I guess but I find myself becoming a bit resentful. I finally said no recently because I had something already scheduled for the day and hated myself for it. She was so upset and said she didn't have anyone to rely on. 

I'm just tired. Tired of hearing her complain about a man who she'll never leave because her oldest needs the support she can give by being a stay at home mom. I'm tired of watching my friend burn the candle at both ends while this guys bops around like he doesn't have three young kids at home. I don't know, it's not about me in the slightest really but I feel sad about the whole situation.

1jr5iks,2025-04-04 06:40:25,offmychest,"I miss him, but I drew something today","I think, this is the first time in a while I've felt a little okay. I drew something, painted something actually. I painted something and it came out really beautiful and I'm very proud of it. I'm very surprised it came out so light and happy and not so terrible. You see, most of the time when I paint something the way I feel now it definitely reflects my state of mind. To be fair I don't think I've ever felt this lonely, in a real tangible way. 

When I was younger and I'd feel lonely it was different. It was different because it wasn't real. I'd miss things that never existed, like characters from TV shows. I was missing things I never had. But now, I'm missing something that was real, something I kept incredibly close to me. Now that it's gone I'm not quite sure what to do with the missing places it left. Worst part is that I have no one to talk about these feelings with. 

I would always talk about things like this with him. My best friend. He was always who I went to when talking with literally everyone else didn't work. It's why I'm here writing this. This is something I would normally call him on the phone for. We would talk for hours at a time. Talk and talk about anything and everything but especially about things that kept us up or things we couldn't quite conceptualize on our own. I remember the day that stopped happening. It happened before our friendship actually ended. That day, when I stopped being about to talk, really talk, to him hurt worse then when our friendship officially ended. I think about it all the time. The only thing I think about more was how I felt during the realization that he had crossed the final line. 
I should have ended our friendship way sooner, before he crossed that line. He crossed that line months before but I was too hopeful to see it. It wasn't him going too far that hurt the most. It was him going too far again. I know I made the right decision cutting him out of my life and myself. That's why it hurts and I feel so lonely. It's because either made the right decision. There's no fixing it and he can never come back, no matter how often I beg in my prayers for him to. 

I should feel better. I feel even worse for it. I just want to spend one more day with him before it all went to shit. It wouldn't make a difference though

1jr3a7e,2025-04-04 04:19:28,offmychest,I wanna kill myself,"I feel like today I was cursed. Me and my family are on vacation week. Yesterday we went to the beach. I had so much fun I enjoyed the beach and we rented a boat. Then after all the enjoyment I was holding my phone and I fell in the water. Take note, beach water breaks your phone even if it’s water resistant. anyway I immediately checked to see if my phone still worked snd it did and I searched what I can do cause of course the salt water can damage whatevers inside your phone. It said to get water thats clean and not salty for sure and I did and I rinsed it. It worked properly throughout the day. 
At night me and my boyfriend were chatting, and we argued. I felt horrible going to sleep I just wanted to cry cause we always argue alot and we sleep feeling like pure shit. I woke up at 6am cause we planned to ride the boat again before the sun gets too hot. I prepared and my phone was working absolutely perfectly. We walked to the beach and took some photos on my phone then I had to leave it in the room cause honestly I was alrsady scared to get kt near the water so I left kt to charge in the room too. 
We had fun we laughed we enjoyed we swam and did whatever that made us happy until we were finished and I had to head back to my room just ro find my phones screen flickering. I turned it off immediately and I didnt know what to do. I felt like I was almost panicking because my boyfriend might think I left him or got super mad at him. So I thought maybe theres still water inside or whatever and I told my dad and he said just keep it turned off for 24 hours. I tried to use my moms ipad to text my boyfriend but I cant login to any of my accounts because it needed my phone to proceed. Then I went out to get something only to realize that the sandals I left on the back of our truck foot stand were gone and only one sandal left and I realized my dad used the truck and went somwhere. They were expensive and they had probably fallen somewhere on the road and I told my dad and he said lets find it on the road on the way home. Then we went and tried to find it on the side of the streets and there was no sandal found, it’s getting more horrible. We then just went home and it was a 3 hour drive and I had to drive that long. We decided to stop over a phone repair shop. I went to the shop and I explained and then they diagnosed waht
 Was really wrong. Turned out my LCD or display had been damaged, my camera too, and my speaker. And to get it fixed and actually usable, my mom paid $110. I felt horrible. We also didn’t tell my dad because he’ll get really mad that we spent that much on my phone that we planned on selling before but I didn’t want yet and I feel like I’ll get yelled at anytime or get scolded for my actions. I just want a break.
Now that my phone was fixed the first thing I did was to text my boyfriend. The messages he had sent were a goodmorning and nothing else. I knew I was fucking screwed. I explained to him and he told me he wanted a talk with me when he gets home. I wanna fucking cry everything is horrible. My mom is always mad at me throughout the whole thing and I was just scared and anxious and I just want everything to end.
This may not sound so bad but having narcissistic parents is just so hard to deal with.

My mom defends him and says that he’s dealing with stress over work, but how is that an excuse to take it out on the people who did nothing to cause this stress? There are people who work 2-3 jobs, people who work while in college, and people who are dealing with war, yet he acts like he has the world on his shoulders. The house goes from happy and relaxed to quiet and uptight whenever he arrives home. I notice myself getting mad at friends or family without meaning to and beating myself up over it afterwards. My 3 siblings are the same. I hate when I see my cousins and their families, and they seem happy and as if they can tell each other anything, and you see us, and we look depressed and as if we hate each other. Growing up, I thought that my quietness meant that I was mature, but I feel like I’m suffocating and hiding it with a smile.

1jr31dt,2025-04-04 04:05:29,offmychest,I wish everyone forgot my birthday today,"I know it sounds kinda stupid, but I really just want everyone to forget it was even my birthday today. Today is my birthday (if I didn't make that obvious!) and I really wanted to visit my dads grave and my mom said it would be OK. The day came and it turned out that she planned a whole family visit involving my brother and step-dad. SHE KNOWS I HATE MY BROTHER AND KNOWS HE'S RUINED MY LIFE! I literally have so many examples such as:

\- Him telling people about my dads death in detail AROUND ME even though I stated that I didn't want people to know. Mom only gave him a slap on the wrist.

\- Him telling everyone about my anxiety attack.

\- My mom allowing him to join events/classes that i'm in (events such as some of my school trips) and he always caused a scene whenever something didn't go his way. My classmates looked at me differently because of him and I was never really able to form actual connections because they thought I was just like him. My mom always excused him because of his autism and it just upsets me that nothing ever happened.

After she told me I went to go cry in my room and she was POUNDING ON MY DOOR yelling at me to open up. It literally took me screaming at her to go away that she backed off. She told me after I opened the door that she wouldn't take my brother anymore and she turned to him and said SHE WAS SORRY FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO TAKE HIM?? WHAT?? HE LITERALLY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I WANTED TO GO, YOU TOLD HIM WITHOUT ASKING ME IF I WAS OK WITH IT FIRST?? I get that IF he wanted to go see my dads grave then it would be ok, but EARLIER SHE TOLD ME THAT ONLY ME AND MY STEP DAD WOULD ACTUALLY GO IN AND SEE HIM WHILE THEY WAITED???? turns out she planned that we were gonna have lunch after and she gave a whole speech about ""celebrating instead of grieving"" when I JUST went to go visit my dads grave. I asked to go back into the car and had to BEG before my step-dad took me while she just scoffed. SHE JUST FUCKING SCOFFED????

SHE WANTS TO EXCUSE HERSELF GETTING ANGRY AT ME SHOWING SIGNS OF SADNESS AS A ""MOTHERLY THING"" AND THAT SHE JUST WANTS TO PROTECT ME, AND THEN SHE PULLS THAT?? I literally cannot believe her and i'm so fucking pissed.

I got home and thanked my step-dad for making the day more bearable (he was comforting me the whole time and was making sure I was OK) and am currently just hiding away in my room. Today wasn't my fucking birthday, it was just an excuse to have a family lunch AND DINNER LATER!! My mom never said SORRY TO ME for making ME feel like shit for crying. She said sorry to my brother for not being able to take him even though he was never even MEANT TO GO! SHE JUST INVITED HIM ALONG LIKE SHE ALWAYS DOES!!

I'm sorry, I literally cannot vent about this to anyone I know because i'm scared they'll tell my mom. I'm scared that i'm being entitled and that today shouldn't be ALL about me but it really feels like it was just another family event waiting to happen. All I wanted to do was visit my dad on my birthday but now I feel like shit for even bringing it up ever.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jr31dt/i_wish_everyone_forgot_my_birthday_today/

P.S. We got in an argument today because I purchased a $5 bottle of 24 Tylenol pills to hold me over until we get some online or at Costco.

1jr51ab,2025-04-04 06:08:01,offmychest,I'm lonely and filled with so much sadness and rage,"I'm in my mid 20s (f) and for the past 6 years, I've been fighting depression. This past year, it seems to be getting worse and with my current job, it amplifies my loneliness. I work evenings to night time at a hospital, so even though I live with my mom and sibling, I don't see them until the weekends (or not at all because they have their significant others that they spend time with). My friends also have significant others so they don't talk to me as much as they used to. I wish this wasn't the case. 

My only solace were my two dogs. They brought me so much joy and companionship that my deep loneliness went away. One of them was a puppy and the other was an adult dog, getting close to senior but I had her for 7 years. The puppy got parvo in September (despite being vaccinated). It was a very stressful time with so much emotional rollercoasters, money gone, and lack of support from my family (emotionally). My mom forced me to put him down even though the vet told me the vaccine company would cover the cost if I waited a couple of hours until their offices open (it was 2 am). She kept yelling at me and kept saying things that tore my heart. In the end, she won. That same morning, she left to go on a trip with her boyfriend.

I guess I shouldn't have expected her to drop the trip because her daughter was mourning over her dog. I  just thought since I was there when she got cancer (skipped a semester of college to take care of her) that she would also be there for me. I guess it was wrong of me to assume that. But what hurt so much was that no one really came to check up on me. Why am I always expected to lend a hand but others can't do the same? Am I wrong? I don't know. But I swear, I felt like this incident altered my brain chemistry because there's so much rage, sadness, and loneliness inside of me that I feel like I'm being consumed by it slowly.

Fast forward to March and my mom lost my dog in the morning while I was asleep. I kept telling her when she let my dog out, to put her on a leash or at least watch the dog because my dog has this tendency of going to a neighbor's house to play with their dog. But like always, she ignored my warnings. She let my dog out and lost her. 2 hrs after she lost her, my mom woke me up. In my haste to find my dog, I fell down the stairs and ended up hurting my foot really bad. So I couldn't search for her as throughouly as I should have and I had to go to work. My mom disregarded my emotions once again when I was crying over her losing my dog and throughout the next two weeks I was so angry I couldn't speak at all but the basic stuff at work in fear of snapping on someone innocent. 

Last week, I hired a pet investigator to help me find my dog and she was able to find out that she was picked up and that there's a man that's been taking down my missing dog posters. I had a small argument with my mom about her paying the fees for my dog's return (reward or investigator fee) since it was her fault my dog got lost but she's very cheap and only cares about using her money to buy more houses (yeah she's a landlady unfortunately \*sighs\*) or for herself and her vacations. It's always money with her (and with my sibling too). I feel insane being in this family that only cares about money when I'm not like that. Anyway, the last update I got from my dog was that the man who took down my posters is somewhere in this neighborhood. More to come. I just hope the man didn't sell my dog off. She's my baby and I miss her so much. I would do anything to get her back. I will sell everything I have just to have her again. 

I just wished my mom listened to my warnings but it seems like the theme of my life is that my gut is always right but whenever I try to warn people, they never listen. No one ever listens to me. It's as if I'm mute to them. 

Why am I writing this? I don't know. I think I just want someone to listen to me since the people in my life don't. I wish someone would comfort me. I've always had to be strong and take care of other people in their time of need but when I need someone to help me, no one shows up and I have to do everything on my own. I'm angry at everything. I'm seething in rage but I have to pretend I'm ok.

In the past, I used to self harm when I was angry at myself. I've been clean for 5 years but these events has me itching to start again. Since I work at a hospital, I've been considering walking to the emergency room after work just because sometimes I don't feel safe and really need someone to intervene in case I do something dumb. 

Sorry this is long and if there's any errors or if nothing makes sense or if it's too sensitive. I'm writing this while crying lmaooooo ",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jr51ab/im_lonely_and_filled_with_so_much_sadness_and_rage/
1jr4onm,2025-04-04 05:44:58,offmychest,I want him to forget I existed,"TW: Abuse 



When I turned 18 I had my experience talking to a guy romantically. It developed quickly. As time went on, he’s behavior was more unpredictable. Before I could blink I was in a verbally abusive relationship. 

No one truly ever tells people just how much a relationship like that affects you. I truly felt like I lost my sanity. The happiness I felt being with him when things were great was so addictive. But then being threatened and yelled out made me feel so miserable, that all I wanted to do was go back to him so I could make the anxiety stop. 

Even admitting that makes me sick. But the truth is, it takes the right person to make you forget what kind of person you were before them. I’m glad I remembered myself. 

It’s been a few years since then and I’m healed from it. I was pretty depressed then and after the relationship, so it makes it hard for me to remember every detail. But I’m doing so much better and have such an amazing boyfriend. One who I hope to marry. The love I have for him is so pure and I truly believe in his love. I have zero doubts when he tells me how much I mean to him. I’ve been so grateful for that. 

Lately, I’ve been bothered by the fact that I’ve been in other fleeting relationships. I didn’t know I’d get to experience the love I have now. Knowing that the abusive man knew the person I was, makes me feel sick. I worry sometimes that he’ll ruin the happiness I have with my current partner. So I genuinely hope he’ll forget about me. I pray that I can enjoy my love and happiness that I found now. I don’t want my past poor judgment to ruin this.

I feel extremely depressed from time to time and I can't get out of bed, much less care about work. And then I slowly recover. But then I'm just trying to keep up with course work and playing catch up, and I have no time to learn anything or upskill. I don't know what I want or what I should be doing, and I just end up rotting. Catching up, rotting, catching up, rotting.


I've tried therapy but I can't be vulnerable, especially to a stranger. I feel like the people in my life have better things to do than deal with my shit so I can't open up to them either. I can't make friends. I piss off existing ones by being distant weeks at a time. I feel so overwhelmed by everything that I'm not.


I thought that once you got out of a depressive episode, you're stronger and can do better. But I feel like it's like I'm crawling out of a hole. Each time I drag myself out, eventually I fall back in. And each time I've fallen back in, it gets harder to drag myself out. I'm so incredibly tired and I don't know why I'm doing anything anymore.

1jqjc46,2025-04-03 14:05:39,offmychest,I hate how much I seek male attention and I just want it to stop,"I know this may give some odd vibes but just bear with me.

The things I’ve done to get a crumb of attention from a male human, especially one that appealed to me.

I’ve sacrificed nights to listen to some man vent about his heartbreak, hoping that he’d realise that he could confide in me as a close friend and that eventually perhaps we would become lovers. Only to have that guy never talk to me again after he finished venting.

I’ve given out millions of heartfelt compliments to men especially when I saw that other women weren’t giving some man much validation, in the hopes that he’d realise that there was someone who appreciated him - me. And how foolish of me that was, to lower my personality for a man who probably wouldn’t even think to be interested in me.

At school during lunch times I would join ’the boys’ in their handball games, thinking I was ’so cool for not being like the other girls’ and that the boys would recognise me as a friend and possibly eventually one of them would pursue me romantically.

I was a stripper for a few months (in my university years). I thought that if I tried to emphasise on my ”sexiness” (ie primal attraction by flaunting my body) then I would be able to literally bathe in male attention because men are ultimately monkey-brained right? People say men screw anything and I was at least something, right? But no, a few measly hundreds of dollars and an overwhelming amount of social anxiety put me off trying to approach men and convince them to pay me for a lap dance.  

Not a single guy has ever shown any genuine interest in me. Every guy from Tinder, from uni, from work, from Instagram, that ever seemed ’interested’ in me was just after a hookup or two. I can’t even post on dating subreddits because I’ve never even got to date anyone in the first place, lol.

And when I’m down on my luck, when I’m rotting alone in my bedroom as an unemployed 25 year old woman, I go online to reach out to men and get them to notice me. I’m either trying to be the funny girl, the nice girl, the cool ’based’ girl, or just be ’myself’ - trying to see which costume works. 

But that rage I feel, every time some guy ignores me, just like the rage I felt when I observed every other girl get hit on by some guy whilst no man batted an eye at me, it consumes me.

I hate myself for being so desperate for male attention. Every time a guy responds to me, it makes me feel seen, it gives me a dopamine rush and even more so if I think he’s hot. 

And if some guy doesn’t so much as address that I exist in the conversation or space, I feel like ripping my heart out of my chest. I know it sounds dramatic, but it’s how I feel. And I want to stop feeling this way.

I want to stop associating male attention with my self worth. And yes, I have heard of people saying that your self worth shouldn’t be defined by a man or anyone for that matter. I have heard that if I stay true to myself then ’the right guy’ will come along. 

But no - how can I ever feel worthy if my worth can’t even be acknowledged by another person? Doesn’t it just sound like cope to stay hoping that the ’right guy’ comes along when the reality will be that no one would ever appreciate me for who I am? And why can’t men just acknowledge I exist? That I’m still a woman worthy of appreciation. I’m not asking for much.

TLDR I get super angry when men ignore me and this rage makes me lose my mind but I want this feeling to stop, and I desperately want to stop seeking attention from men but I don’t know how I can convince my mind to.",14,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jqjc46/i_hate_how_much_i_seek_male_attention_and_i_just/

No, that’s not true. I don’t like the version of myself I am right now. I don’t like the friend, mother, wife, child or sister I am. 
It feels like I’m living in an alternate universe. 

A universe where I’m extremely lonely but also have a network, a community. 
It’s so weird. 
The depth of loneliness is so unreal. 
Yet I cannot talk to anyone about it. 
Actually, no that’s not true either. I have tried to talk to several people about it. 
My husband, my best friend, my mom. But I don’t think anyone actually understands. I see them lose interest when I start to explain what it feels like. 
It is too cerebral. 
So here I am, lonely as heck,
yet surrounded by people. 

This last 9 years have been so surreal. 
But it’s definitely gotten worse since Covid. 
I feel stuck. I’m trying to figure out what to do. 
How do I pivot out of this weird space?
How do I stop feeling like my life is a round hole in a square peg?
When do I get to be myself?
Who am I really?
I don’t know. 

Because I actually don’t recall when I was ever myself. 
I’m not the mother I want to be. 
I’m not the wife I wish I could be.
And I’m most definitely not the friend I want to be.
I want to be able to say how I feel, when I feel.
I want to be able to express myself unfiltered, like most people seem to be able to do, especially to me.
But I’m not ever able to. 
I’m constantly censoring myself. 
Having internal monologues,
Conversation practices before I can engage with anyone.

The good friend.
The support system.
The caring mother.
The dutiful wife.
But the lonely part is I’m not truly myself in any of these roles. 
I don’t understand why I keep attracting people who feel the need to be their most authentic self with me. 
But no one makes room for me to be my most authentic self. 
Or is everyone else just pretending?
Does life also feel mismatched for everyone else and no one is saying anything?
God this is so exhausting.

I had to leave home and can never come back or else face a significant risk to my life. this is one of the most difficult moments of my life my dad is a malignant narcissist with violent tendencies and I guess I asserted my autonomy too much

Honestly idk what to do.

i snuck out and can't tell them my location lol. Things have been escalating fast with my dad. I’ve been stupidly confronting him, as the scapegoat in my family, and he’s been furious at losing control. He posed me as serverly mentally unwell to my mom to discredit me and one nigh, he made me fear for my life. So I left.

I then told my gf abt this, said I needed help, said I had no money, nowhere to go, and feared for my life. Instead of providing any sense of comfort, she told me she didn’t care and broke up with me. She was all o had left. She blocked me. Then she texted me back, and apologized, but she said she can’t be my gf anymore.

I don’t know what to tell my mom. She has CPTSD, is terrified of my dad, and has extreme anxiety. I’ve been gone for 2 days. Honestly don’t know where to go or what to do. I already have to deal with CPTSD, anxiety, AuDHD, and depression, but I want to fight. And staying at a house for 1-2 days. So now i have no friends, will lose my family, and lost my gf. lol.

1jr2ucc,2025-04-04 03:54:31,offmychest,Ended relationship of 9 years with my boyfriend,"Hi, I’m (26, F), and my ex is (27, M). We were together for almost nine years, and he was ultimately my best friend.

From the beginning of our relationship, we faced many challenges, and I struggled with trust issues and anxiety about my self-worth. Back then, he had a habit of looking at other attractive women on Instagram—women who looked nothing like me. That changed my perception of love, making me constantly seek validation and fueling our arguments.

Eventually, we both ended up cheating on each other, but we were willing to work things out and get back together. I craved validation so badly that I made the worst mistake of my life. But even after reconciling, I couldn’t move past the betrayal. The trust issues and his actions lingered in my mind.

Yesterday, I brought up marriage because I see my friends finding love, getting engaged, and settling down with their soulmates. I want that too. I’ve waited for him for almost nine years.

I understand that he’s still trying to become financially stable, and that’s what he told me. But I just wanted to feel that he was committed and serious about our future. In the end, we broke up. He said we were incompatible, that I didn’t understand his career and his struggles. He wanted to remain friends and promised that once he was financially stable, he would propose to me.

I begged him to stay and be with me—I wanted to get married. But he told me we couldn’t be together and get married because I’m too difficult and that we both need to work on ourselves first. It broke my heart because he was so calm like nothing happened. After nine years, how could he let me go so easily?

Should I just accept reality now? He never truly loved me, right? Please, I need your perspective. What should I do?

1jr2885,2025-04-04 03:20:47,offmychest,I cut my arms at work and almost no one that still works there knows.,"I work in a restaurant, endlessly saving for college. (19, male). I'm very good at cooking here now, but when I started I had lots of trouble. It was much different work environment then I was used to, and I got in trouble all the time. I was getting yelled at for something new everyday. I've always had issues with self worth, but this made that skyrocket. I was getting depressed, and eventually, I starting cutting myself to cope with the pain. It was a myriad of issues on top of that, but this new stress was the final push. Eventually, I had a really bad day, and my main boss, (who was really the only one who would yell) yelled at me to clock out and go home. I just lowered my head, and shuffled away. On my way to the breakroom, I picked up a chef's knife, and starting slashing at my arm with tears streaming down my face. Blood was dripping down my arm as I turned to leave. No one noticed, and I went out the door. But before I completely left, I went to my other manager, and confessed. It was obvious he didn't know how to handle something like this, both professionally and personally. He took me to the manager office, handed me a band aid, and told another manager of a different area of business in the restaurant, who I know personally and is a family friend. I left, and came back the next day like nothing had happened. My main manager, who was the one that yelled, never found out that I cut myself, and only just found out a month ago that I had a ""breakdown"" after one of his fits. The manager I showed my cuts to told him recently, but understandably left out the detail of the self harm. A few weeks ago, that manager transferred to a different location. I believe I few waitresses found out about it, but as far as I know, it was never spoken of again. The boss who yelled really likes me now, and I never get in trouble anymore, other than just the occasional small correction or reminder. But I still hate him. And I still cut myself, but not as frequently. Truthfully, it is mainly loneliness that does it. I started high school at the same time as the pandemic, so I switched to online school and never made any girlfriends (or regular friends). I just want to hold someone. I just want to feel cared about by somebody different.

when he is upset with me, that’s the only time i feel like i have concrete proof that he cares about me. so if he hasn’t gotten mad at me in a long time, i get scared that he’s losing interest in me

i do not take it out on him. i do not do things to piss him off on purpose to get that sense of security. i do everything i can to make him feel secure. which makes him a happier, more pleasant person. which means he does not get mad at me often. which means i get scared that he does not like me. 

i’m EXHAUSTED

i have also told him all of this. i tell him everything. but i know he is starting to get exhausted, and he’s communicated that to me (which has also caused its own set of miserable late night mental spirals). has anyone else gone through this and pulled themself together without burning out their partner by asking for constant reassurance?

1jqhv5b,2025-04-03 13:02:46,offmychest,UPDATE: I'm very proud of my husband today,"Thanks to everyone who commented on my last post which you can go see on my profile since I can't link to it here. Firstly I'd like to say thank you to everyone who was supportive, it meant a lot and I spent a lot of time getting misty-eyed every time I saw a new comment. I read some to him last night, he was so touched. Seriously, you guys are amazing!!

So for those looking for an update, here it is: my husband had that meeting with the boss this morning. He didn't have time to get a lawyer, but he recorded it. Basically the boss wanted him to take over the manager's position as production manager for the entire design and fabrication department (for context if anyone is interested, they're a large format printing company and print banners, building wraps, billboards, car wraps etc and other smaller things like promotional materials like mugs, pens, stickers, drink trays, promotional gifts etc etc etc.) So the boss wanted him to take over production and still do the designs. It would mean more work, more stress, more authority...... and not more money.

He said that apparently I am earning more than the boss is, and he can't afford to up his salary more than 2%. Which I think is BS. Like fuck OFF, that's such a lie. He has three kids in a really expensive private school, a big house in a nice neighbourhood, and multiple vehicles. Add to that the mortgage for the office & factory space, the machinery & large format printers which is a cool few million altogether (in my currency because I'm not based in America). He also gives his kids literally whatever they want and they take regular holidays.

I know he does a fair bit of business on a ""I scratch your back, you scratch mine"" basis, so his school fees might be partially subsidised by doing free branding for the school a few times a year. But even then I still don't believe he can't afford to pay one of his oldest employees what he's worth according to experience + qualifications. Just a competitive, market-related salary? Nah.

You also can't just get extended lines of credit in perpetuity, so even if he's got loans for his house, cars, machinery, office & factory space... I still don't believe that he's simply can't afford it. He could have investments or savings, I guess. But my husband has seen the quotes for some of the jobs they do, and I'm talking hundreds of thousands worth - up to a million for a building wrap/billboard. Even if most of it is being swallowed up by debt, it doesn't account for the kid's gaming rigs, steering wheels for racing games, vintage pinball machines, a custom foosball table once, new ipads/iphones whenever there's a new one out. He also collects old Alfa Romeo cars he's hoping to fix up and I've seen them. There are about 4 chassis/vehicles parked next to the factory. It just doesn't add up to me. Just thinking back to how we struggled to make ends meet before I got this job without having kids to pay for, I just don't believe it. And I mean it when I say it, their lifestyle is LUSH.

I think the boss was hoping that the manager gone + better position, more authority & control would be enough to keep my husband there, but to be honest his salary was just above minimum wage. He could probably get a better salary somewhere else in a mid-level position without being treated so poorly.

He's still considering reporting it to the CCMA (the public entity that resolves workplace disputes in my country) but for now he's quit and is at home and looking for work. He could stay home if he wanted but I just personally believe that he needs a purpose other than cleaning the house and cooking, and he wants to earn his own money so he can spoil himself and me.

On the charge of threatened assault front - no news there. Justice moves sloooooow here and the cops have bigger fish to fry than threatened assault charges so honestly if anything concrete actually happens before the manager catches a flight to the UK in a few weeks, I'll be surprised.

What's most important is that he's out of that environment and alive. He's already feeling so much better, I can see it in the way he holds himself, walks around, talks. So there you have it!

And to the people who think this is fake, that's cool LMAO. The fact is that a person can get used to a lot of poor treatment at work and for a long time if they're desperate for the money. Jobs here aren't plentiful and the cost of living is pretty high and only getting higher. I only just got a new job that has provided him the breathing room he needed and the confidence to leave. Also we're talking about a severely depressed person here. Yeah, it took three years and a single, first high paycheck from his partner's new job to convince him that it's possible to earn more and be treated better. It's also laughable to assume that everyone (let alone a DTP artist designing entire fucking billboards) works off a laptop instead of a desktop, I don't know. Maybe get real LOL. That's all there is to it, you can believe that this happened or not, I'm gonna move on and enjoy having a happy, alive husband.

edit: I also posted to a local subreddit a few weeks ago asking about the legalities about ""my friend's"" treatment at work. It was actually about my husband, but I didn't want to put his issues on ",14,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jqhv5b/update_im_very_proud_of_my_husband_today/
1jr1gt8,2025-04-04 02:40:26,offmychest,I feel conflicted about my marriage,"Hey everyone,



I’m feeling really conflicted right now, and I just need to get some of this off my chest. Lately, I’ve been increasingly detached from my wife. Even though she tries to be light-hearted and connect, I can’t shake this heavy feeling of obligation that’s replacing the genuine joy I once felt. I miss the person I used to be—the part of me that was free, spontaneous, and truly alive.



These days, even my early morning drives, which used to clear my mind, now leave me feeling empty. I keep getting overwhelmed by thoughts of Raye—someone with whom I once felt truly seen, heard, and appreciated. It’s a stark contrast to the numbness and confinement I experience in my marriage right now.



I’m caught in a really painful conflict. On one hand, I deeply care about my wife and the vows we made. On the other, I’m drawn to a sense of freedom that feels completely out of reach at the moment. The constant pressure of responsibilities and the burnout that comes with them have left me feeling like I’ve lost my identity. Even small things—like the urge to check my phone or the worry about missing a text—remind me of the constraints I feel, making it hard to be present even when I’m physically with her.



I’m struggling to understand whether this overwhelming disconnection is just burnout and depression, or if it’s a sign of a deeper loss of connection in my marriage. The guilt from these conflicting emotions is crushing, and the thought of initiating a difficult conversation with my wife fills me with dread. I feel torn between the pain of losing a piece of myself and the fear of hurting someone I once loved so deeply.



Has anyone else experienced something like this? How did you navigate those overwhelming feelings when you felt trapped between responsibility and the longing for the freedom you once knew?",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jr1gt8/i_feel_conflicted_about_my_marriage/

Ok anyways like I was saying we are going to call my boyfriend “firefly”. Firefly has been doing things that make me feel like he doesn’t like me anymore when we first started dating he didn’t have social media at all because his parents didn’t allow him to because his older brother was caught doing something that his parents didn’t approve of so his parents decided to punish all of their kids by taking away their social media for a while.Everyday after school while we wait on a couch in our school lobby for our parents to come and get us but today… I looked over and he was on his phone I notice immediately that he was on instagram but I did not say anything when it was time for me to leave I soon looked him up on instagram his account is private so I couldn’t see who he was following and who was following him he has a small amount of followers about 13 but here’s the problem there is this girl that he sits next to in our class (our teacher has assigned seats we did not have assigned seats in her class in the beginning of our relationship i sit across the table from him)while he has been sitting next to her I have notice tiny things that seem like he’s has a crush on her he try’s so hard to talk to her I cringe bc of it and he laughs at everyone of her jokes and everything she does.. I usually read my book in that class because I’m so embarrassed that he doesn’t talk to me (I could try harder to be more present so that he starts to talk to me more but I’m really bad at being social) but like I said earlier in the story he follows her.. when I go to his account it still says “New” (I do not follow him and he doesn’t have my account info bc it’s a random account that I only use to watch videos) but he never once asked me for my account why is my boyfriend following some girl in our class instead of me? I cringe just thinking about it anyways today he was supposed to sit next to  her but someone was sitting and her chair she ended up going to the restroom before class started but she left her things.. she left her backpack and water bottle she has a water bottle with a sticker that is (TW mockery of religion I believe in Jesus so I do not like mockery of him)Jesus Christ related someone at the table made fun of it (they weren’t talking to me so I didn’t say anything when this person did that) but my boyfriend started laughing.. I feel crazy for saying this but when he laughed it seemed like he didn’t even find the joke funny I feel like he actually like her sticker and then on her backpack was her hair clip attached to the handle he started to FREAKING PLAY with the hair clip!! (She was still in the restroom during this time) I was so embarrassed WHAT SHOULD I DO!?!

1jpuduv,2025-04-02 17:27:44,offmychest,My wife didn’t take no for an answer and it’s broken me.,"I have never felt so unhappy in my entire life and I’m not sure what to do. 

My marriage is a mess. I never wanted to get to this point but I’m really struggling to find a way back. I think the thing that’s hurting me the most still is that she doesn’t take no for an answer when it comes to intimacy despite being SA’d as a child. I could just about tolerate her guilt tripping but that one night where she didn’t take no for an answer ruined me. The worst thing is I still would have tried to find a way to forgive her, but when I spoke to her about it the next day, even when I was explaining how triggering it was she did not take any responsibility or validate my feeling. At one point, she closed her eyes and looked in another direction on the sofa as if she’s were going to sleep. 

There’s so much gone on, I am sick of talking about it but I need somewhere to get this off my chest. 

I feel so numb to everything, yet still I am catching myself saying that I want to die nearly every hour of every day. I don’t want to hurt myself, but I just want to feel better. I’m numb but in pain. I don’t enjoy my life anymore but also don’t want to be without her. I just wish none of this has ever happened.

1jqziey,2025-04-04 00:59:59,offmychest,Elderly grandmother uses destroy mental health,"Edit: skip to bold sentence for start of story

Last year I moved in with my grandmother after getting into graduate school, needless to say things didn’t necessarily go as planned.

Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love her and caring for her, seeing her happy, and continue to live a full life at her health fills me with immense joy. She’s always been a little spicy and more than a little self centered, which has only been amplified as nears 100. Again, love her to pieces but boy is she good at ripping your mental health to bits.

I was really only supposed to be here for two years max, but the level of care required was far beyond what I, or anyone in my family, really anticipated. Cooking, dr’s appts, groceries, random people she wants to meet because suddenly she can now bc her grandson is her with a car - whatever, I just do it because at her age it’s quite extraordinary and we want her to keep kicking.

The obvious problem was time constraints. The not so obvious problem is my mental health - diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and adhd. And while you might not necessarily notice because I can put on a good front, death by a thousand micro aggressions is very real when you can’t relax because you’re anxious both in public but also now at home. 

In the span of one year, I had to stop over 5 scam attempts - the last one requiring a full on nuclear approach: credit freeze, new account numbers, etc. I’ve been helping her with her medicine for the past 7 months once she finally admitted she needed help and I had to count her pills to notice she either a) wasn’t taking them or b) was double dosing some days. And I also picked up doing her vitals every morning for the past 4 months.

And I was supposed to be doing graduate school while doing all of this? For reference, my other grandparents we got them private nurses before they passed and she’s long surpassed them in age.

**Now as to what spurred this post?**

She’s been serving this neighbor of hers breakfast and dinner almost daily for the past 30 years. I don’t really enjoy interacting with him that much but it’s fine because he’s her friend and that’s what’s most important. But he just sits there while she literally serves him as if it’s the 1950s but she’s 98 man! Get up and pour your own coffee! She can barely hold the pot!

I digress. Anyway, tonight, I went downstairs to put her and his dishes away because he’d left. Just kidding he’s coming back for tea. (Note: it’s been a long day, she hasn’t had a nap, and had family visiting from out of town all day earlier)

I watch her almost fumble the electric kettle and think, ok, I’m just gonna hang out because she’s clearly tired and needs some help but won’t move unless she asks for it or *really* needs it - I had asked her and she said no.

Well, she puts the tea pot with this mornings tea in the microwave. I stop her. And let the screaming commence: “I’ve done this before! I know what I’m doing!” 

I go, “ok, grandma. I know, ok.” And she keeps screaming then tries to microwave the tea pot again.

At this point I move in and take the tea pot from her as gently as possible and bring it to the table. I pour the old tea into a mug and microwave it for a minute.

She continues to keep screaming at me, takes the tea pot, and then starts to pour water from the brita filter into it. I tell her the water is boiling for yours and your neighbor’s tea. More screaming but the tea pot has been placed down.

At this point, her irredeemable neighbor has already entered the house again, sat down, and listened to her rail at me for at least 5 minutes. And I’m just taking it, “ok. Yes. Of course you know what you’re doing,” as she paces around the kitchen huffing screaming at me, “what are you doing! I don’t need your help! Go away! Screw you!”

Totally-not-taking-advantage-of-the-elderly neighbor just sits there and says **nothing**

By now, the water has boiled after she had stopped it and I restarted it - knowing why she was doing it in the first place - but having moved in front of the kettle because she has in fact burned herself multiple times in the past serving this still-just-sitting-there-neighbor. I really don’t want her to burn herself anymore. That’s why I cook breakfast and dinner for her most of the time.

I pour the slightly cooled, but still boiling water, into the tea pot and put the lid on. She screams at me, “what are you doing!” Then flips the lid off and almost shoves her hand into the very much just under boiling temperature water. Fortunately I was fast enough to get more arm in and pull it away.

More screaming. I’m just standing there wondering what kind of wrong I must’ve done to someone in my past life. She moves to the dining room and asks her neighbor, sweetly, mind you, “do you want some cookies with your tea?”

He says no. I think I might’ve died a little inside, though.

More: “I don’t know what the hell you’re doing! You must be doing that for yourself!” 

And I’m just muttering, “yes I’m doing it for myself so I don’t watch you burn yourself” 

She finally moves to sit as I tell her I’m taking the tea pot. I walk around to the enter the dining room from the opposite side, ask her neighbor to keep an eye on the pot, then go up to my room.

After sitting in the dark, just breathing for 20 minutes, I figured this would at least be a decent throwaway story.

1jqzcmt,2025-04-04 00:51:52,offmychest,I didn’t miss my mom and I’m not happy she’s back from her trip,"For the past almost week, me and my sister have been at home while our mom was visiting my brother in a different state. Both me and my sister enjoyed the time as it was time where we didn’t have to worry about hurting her feelings or making her feel ignored because we weren’t hanging out with her. I also was very glad as to not emotionally and also sometimes physically take care of her. My sister was my acting guardian for the time being and I felt like I could actually be listened to and treated like the almost-adult I am for once.

To say that to me, this past almost week has been heaven, would be an understatement. Now that my mom’s back, it’s like all my depression, anxiety, and feelings of abandonment are resurfacing again. Instead of coming inside (like I thought she would since she said she missed me and my sister), i had to go outside to her car to say hi, and even then she was paying more attention to her phone and the music playing than me. I know she’s coming back from the trip bc of her mental health and as a way to help her escape the stress of her life for the past few days, but I’m losing my freedom. 

I feel horrible for feeling this way. What child doesn’t want their mother to return home, knowing she brings gifts that she got because it reminded her of them? What child wishes their mother would pay attention to her financial problems and almost hoarding problems instead of getting something because it reminded her of them? What child wishes they didn’t have to hear their own mother doubt their ability to keep a clean house, to take care of themselves?

I don’t feel like a good kid but at the same time, this past week I’ve been able to be a kid emotionally. I haven’t had to be the adult calming down a grown child or an adult trying to make sure their toddler doesn’t throw a tantrum. I haven’t had to be a therapist and it makes me feel sick to my stomach that I feel that way for the woman who gave up so much so that I lived comfortably.

1jqxt0d,2025-04-03 23:37:51,offmychest,I wish I could say this to my ex.,"So my ex is someone I dated 10 coming up to 11 years ago when I was 18. I knew through my friend circles that he had gotten into a relationship a couple of years ago however at the time I was a few years into my current relationship. I moved on however my ex was my first love/ first young love.

However I found his reddit post last week and saw two post one tagged to relationship advise about his fresh ex was texting him and how he should deal with it and the other one that kind of tugged my heart strings called lost and lonely. 

I went though the reddit post lost and lonely of him talking about how it had been at the time it was 2 months since the break up, how he was left with a house that should of been there home, how he felt he had no friends or close family to support him in his dark time and how all he dose is sleep but is luckly he has a dog to get him out the house. 

It's was weird to me because I went through a phase where my teenage-self, she ravelded in his pain.But then moments later my I wanted to reach out just to make sure he was fully okay. I put my phone down and went to sleep however the next day I found myself writing a small story about 2 people meeting on the beach who knew eachother years ago, they sat on a bench and just talked to eachother about there life's, how she had just got her license to drive, a promotion in her job and moved out of her mother's home years ago and got a small flat with her bf untill they could work out away for a house. The fella would talk about his life how he changed jobs, got his new dog and talk about how he meet and fell in love with someone new only to be deal with the breakup, talking about his currently feelings, they heal eachother befor going there separate ways in life again.

I realised how deep down I just by this story I wanted to reach out as a friend just send a message to check on him befor carrying on my own life again however I realise how stupid it would be as he is a chapter in my life that's long passed. 

However if he saw this post I would say

Hey A, 
I seen your post and it broke my heart alittle bit for you. I hope you took some of the comments advice to look after yourself and join some walking groups. It's daunting being in our 30s trying to make new friends, trust me I was in the position 2 year ago when I joined a girls only group in town, however I made some new friends I can trust and have had a laugh with. I honestly hope you find the same ❤️ I'm happy you see a therapist also, you never took me for one to ever seek therapy but I'm happy you did and they will do you some good as time gose on. 
I hope you always know deep down you have a friend at your side spiritually but I kinda hope we do end up like the story where we just run into eachother one day sit down and have a cuppa and chat. No romance just two people who were once in love with eachother talking about there life's, probly taking the mick out of eachother. 
I honestly hope your okay but I know you are. 
Take care of yourself, hun x ",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jqxt0d/i_wish_i_could_say_this_to_my_ex/
1jqwq7y,2025-04-03 22:49:33,offmychest,I just can't handle this anymore,"The past few years of my life have just been so terrible, and I honestly feel like I'm starting to crack now. I just can't keep comforting my mom anymore. Every day is another day of endless sobbing and crying. My Dad cheated on my mom and it changed everything for my family. It made me realize how much of a terrible person he was. He's just...abandoned us. 

For two years now we've had to deal with this, and yet the divorce still hasn't happened. Mom says it will in months, dad needs to turn in papers, claims he already did. A new terrible thing every day. We needed a new car. Got one and the new one is totally shit and needs tons of repairs costing money we don't have. My mom has a TBI and literally can't work. My dad keep saying she can work. He refuses to pay the bills.. He bought a house in Spain to cheat on my mom with, and after years it finally sold and made nothing, and my dad's hid money in accounts in Spain and Switzerland. She's sobbing right now and I just can't handle this anymore. 

I fucking hate my empathy right now. I want to tell her it'll be all right, but it won't. My dad's not here so I just feel like screaming at my mom, telling her to shut up and stop crying, but I know that's wrong, and that feeling is really directed toward my dad. My mom has done nothing wrong, but I just can't fucking handle the sobbing anymore. I fucking hate the fucking sobbing I want to die every time i hear it. We are doomed. We have no money. My dad is holding my mom in contempt of court ( don't know what that means) for random crap like trading the old car to help pay for the new one, saying it was much more expensive. Bullshit.  It was a piece of crap. 

My younger brother is fucking moron who constantly argues with her, and he's been doing this for years and I fucking hate him. She doesn't deserve this. The stress is going to kill her. When she gets stressed she gets absent seizures, but who knows if one of those my kill her or if she'll do it herself. My older brother is a leech, an adult who should be doing more, but still acts like a child. Maybe that's the bipolar disorder that he refuses to treat, but he's out of work and living with us and treats her like shit and she can't order him to go because she's afraid of what he'll say and do and where his own daughter will go.  My sister is the only good sibling, but even she's scarred in her own way, having to mature a lot faster than other girls her age. 

I want to do something, literally anything. I wish there was some fucking magic spell I could do to fix this absolute hell. Every day my mom gets closer and closer to a complete mental breakdown and I just can't handle it. A part of me wants her to die because then she won't be in anymore pain, but that sounds just so evil and terrible. I just can't handle this crap anymore.

I feel so awful all the time. I feel guilty for how i am because i know other people have it harder. 

I wish i was someone else. Like myself but loveable. Interesting and fun. I wanna be kissed, wanted, have friends, go to parties, i remember loving to party when i was a kid. Weddings, birthday parties, any opportunity to dance, i usually had i great time. But now i cant make friends. My chest starts to pound so hard i will shake just at the thought of being outside. I just want to die already.

And its all my fault. I'm not sociable enough, too anxious, too sad. Too weird, too uninteresting, too ugly, too invisible. Easy to forget and hard to love. If i could wake up cured from all of this i would. But this is never going away. Is genetic, is chronic. I'll never be truly happy and its all my fault. People have said in comments on my other posts that maybe later in my mid twenties or even thirties i'll be happy, that thats how they lived. I swear to god, if i have to wait till 29 to find joy i might as well just die now. I refuse to live like this for another year. 

Its been 8 years. It all started when i was 10. In two years i'll have been mentally ill for longer than i have been healthy and happy. 

I would rather just go and be with my dad in heaven or something. 
I really want to ruin everything, and maybe feel something. Go crazy for a year and then die. Dissapear and never come back. 
Why was i born like this? why not any other way? why did i even develop anxiety and depression? There hasnt been a single real trauma in my early childlhood years.

But for at least 6 years I have been in complete denial of how porn has ruined me, and to what extent. 

I have bad depression & anxiety. To the point where I feel extremely uncomfortable to leave the house, get groceries, driving, etc. 

In 2018 my mom committed suicide, and I began isolating more. I lived by myself during this time and spent all day, everyday inside. Talked to friends less. Spent more time online. Got more depressed from the grief. Told myself almost verbatim “if I don’t have the balls to kill myself, I’ll do it with porn and junk food.” Started binging fast food, weed, and porn. 

At some point, decide it’s time to get better. Start cleaning up. I get a cat and move to a new place. 

Start feeling confident to date on Tinder. Match with the most perfect woman I’ve ever met. 

Things are great, albeit they start slow. We fall in love. But I start watching porn again as depression creeps back up, fast. 

Find “gooning” servers on discord. Start downloading thousands of files and chatting with other gooners. Become on a mission to be the #1 feeder (someone who shares porn in the server / DMs for others to masturbate to.) 

I get addicted to cybersex / feeding. Sending porn to men (and one woman) and jerking off together. Usually they would do it on cam, mic, or text. I would type, even roleplay sometimes. 

Girlfriend finds this and she’s devastated. Repeated lying on my end, excuses, and not coming to the terms with the fact of it all: I CHEATED. 

I was addicted, depressed, and selfish. Anyone else have experience with these servers and “feeding”? 

If you love your girlfriend don’t ever do it. Now we’re broken up. Probably for good, and I think that’s for the better. I have an appointment with a therapist on Friday. ",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jqvl2m/how_porn_cybersex_gooning_ruined_my_relationship/
1jpkaae,2025-04-02 09:13:18,offmychest,I'm very proud of my husband today,"NSFW tags for suicide/ideation triggers

Today I am very proud of my husband. He's a graphic designer. He's been working for a company for many years now. It was going well until about three years ago, when his new manager started a brutal, targeted and systematic breaking of his spirit. That's the best way I can explain it.

He is yelled and sworn at every day. Everything is blamed on him, even for things from other departments where he had nothing to do with it. He would be blamed, screamed at, called stupid, treated like a dog. In the many instances where it came out later that he wasn't to blame, he never got an apology. He's been told he's not allowed to talk to the other staff or listen to music while he works. The manager even keeps their shared office space at frigid temperatures, and laughed at him and called him a snowflake when he asked for the AC be turned up. Heatwaves were happening outside, 35°C (95°F) weather and he was inside wearing hoodies and a beanie.

He was even called the r-word the other day. That day he came home crying and went straight to bed. The manager regularly made mistakes and then blamed them on him or threw him under the bus, again never apologising or taking accountability. He is given instructions from his boss, and then contradictory instructions from his manager. When he spoke up saying the boss told him to do something else, he'd be yelled at like, ""just do what I fucking told you."" These instructions were never in writing, and then he'd get yelled at when for doing the wrong thing with no way to prove it. If he said the manager told him to do that, the manager denied it.

As a person in a creative profession, he had a folder saved on his work computer called his ""idea folder."" One day he was getting ready to pitch a few designs to his boss, but saw his manager swoop in with ideas of his own. They were identical to my husband's, and he then found his idea folder deleted from his computer and even removed from the recycle bin. I know this manager stays late in the office every day, at least until 9pm, watching youtube videos. I can only imagine that's when he did this. My husband had no way to prove that his ideas had been stolen, but this was just one in a very long list of abuses he suffered.

When he went to HR, who was friendly with the manager, he was told it's ""your word against his'"" and once when he had recorded evidence of how the manager spoke to him, the manager turned it around and made a big stink about how he was ""recorded without his consent'"" so again, HR did nothing.

It got to the point that he was suicidal and planning to make things official. I recently got a new job that allows my husband to resign and stay home and look for new work without stress or rushing. But one day he gave me all of his passwords... and I got scared. I told him my greatest fear was that I'd get a call from his office one day telling me that they'd found him in the bathroom. He immediately broke down and admitted that that was his plan, because he didn't want me to be the one to find him. He was only waiting ""for me to be okay"" and settled in my new job, when I wouldn't need him anymore, and his death would not impact my life.

I told him to resign as soon as my probation period was over. There are still 2 months to go, but I am settled and part of big company decisions, so I'm secure in my future job security. I told him again, ""just quit and come home."" He said he would wait the next 2 months out. But I think the wait made it worse. Like it was so close that it felt further away. Over the last month I've watched his mental health decline rapidly. He already barely sleeps, is a twig from losing so much weight over the last 3 years, barely eats.

Then yesterday happened. His boss was talking to him about a project for a big client, and the manager was badgering him in his other ear at the same time. He put his hand up and said ""please \[manager\], just give me five minutes to listen to what \[boss\] is saying."" The manager responded with ""don't put your hand in my face, I'll fuck you up.""

My husband, this brave, strong, funny, kind, wonderful man of mine, my best friend, stood up to his bully, and quit on the spot. The boss ran after him, begged him to stay, and told him the manager is emigrating at the end of May. My husband told him he can't work with him anymore. He said ""do you know that I don't need this job? Yesterday my wife cleared more on her own than both of our old salaries combined, I can be a house husband if I want, I don't need you."" He says the boss looked very worried, and more so when he explained some of his grievances, and told him that not a single employee is happy. The boss actually said ""I'd better talk to my staff before I have no more staff left.""

When he walked back in the office after cooling off for 10 minutes, he said ""do you think you can threaten me?"" to the manager, who responded, ""What are you going to do about it?"" My husband said he could lay a charge of threatened assault. The manager said ""sure, go ahead."" SO HE DID LOL. My husband left the office and stopped by the police station to press charges. After that, the boss called him and asked him to come in later this week so they can discuss his future.

I just wanted to make this post to share how proud I am of him. He's come home crying every day for months, he's slammed doors and punched the walls, often coming home at lunch just to have a 20-minute break away from there, to see me and cry before having to go back. He was afraid to tell me but I'm glad he did.

I'm so proud of him. He stood up, fought for himself, and showed a weak man what weakness really looks like.",848,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jpkaae/im_very_proud_of_my_husband_today/
1jqu2j5,2025-04-03 20:59:04,offmychest,Just one less filthy indian who cares,"""Legit can’t take this anymore. I’m sitting here fantasizing about clawing my skin off, layer by layer, till there’s nothing left—just a bloody mess where I used to be. But nah, the pain would be unbearable, and I’m too much of a coward to even start. So instead I’m just praying some rusted-out pickup truck barrels through me at 80 mph, splatters me across the asphalt, and calls it a day. One less dirty-looking Indian staining the world, right? Like, who’d even blink? I’m just a smudge on the planet anyway—ugly, worthless, a walking pile of filth no one asked for. Every mirror I pass reminds me I don’t belong here, every glance from a stranger screams it louder. And here’s the sick, twisted irony: Indian girls the same damn color as me, same brown skin I hate myself for, they reject me too. I’m 17, and even the ones who look like me won’t touch me with a ten-foot pole—like I’m some diseased freak even they can’t stand. They see the same dirt I see, I guess, the same disgusting shade that marks me as less-than. It’s almost funny if it didn’t make me want to scream till my lungs give out. I’m drowning in this black hole of a headspace, and it’s swallowing me whole. No one’s coming to pull me out, and why would they? Just needed to vomit this somewhere before it chokes me out completely.""",1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jqu2j5/just_one_less_filthy_indian_who_cares/
